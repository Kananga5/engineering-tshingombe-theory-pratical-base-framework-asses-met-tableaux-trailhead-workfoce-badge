-explanation: calculation impedance of power source the up streav network the power supply transformers as well as of the electrical lines
Problem consider a 20kv network that supplies a HV / LV substation via 2 m overhead line and MVA generator that supplies in parallel the busbare of the same substation two 1000kva parallel connected transformers euply the LV,busbar which in turn supply 29out gears to 20 motor including the one supplying motor .all motor are rate 50kw all connections cable are identical and all motor are running when the fault occurs the isc3a d up value must be calculated at the variouse fault location indicated in the network diagram.
-point A on the HV busbars with a negligible impedance.
-point B on the LV busbar,at a distance of meter from the transformer.
-Point c on the busbar of an LV su distribution board .
-point D at the terminal of motor Mthen the reverse current of the motor must be calculated at C and B .

It reported to the Committee on: • Progress and status of the certification backlog statistics • Key obstacles to eliminating the certification backlogs • Certification backlog Roll out Plan aimed at addressing the obstacles • Update on progress of the new Integrated Exams IT System (IEITS) • Challenges experienced in the development and deployment of the IEITS DHET updated the Members on the Integrated Examinations Information Technology System (IEITS) that the DHET has been working on with a private service provider. Currently, system requirements and specifications for NC(V) L2 and NATED N4-N6 examination process have been documented and tested with the user community and Umalusi. The focus is now on the finalisation of the interfaces with key stakeholders such as Umalusi, SAQA, SITA printing bureau, Department of Home Affairs, Department of Labour and other departments. The deployment of the new solution was planned to be implemented in a staggered approach per qualification over four months to ensure business continuity. It is envisaged that the deployment will now commence in August 2020. It has been moved from June to August due to comprehensive quality gates for Functional Acceptance Testing (FAT). SITA informed the Committee that backlog reduction will be ramped up in the next few weeks. Besides the technology, SITA will appoint a dedicated programme manager with focused programme resources that will be cross utilised and rolled over to work on activities where quicker reduction benefits can be achieved. There are dedicated DHET and SITA officials that will be allocated to the Backlog Day Zero programme. There will also be swift dataset turnaround times by all stakeholders. SITA projected that there will be about 80% reduction of the backlog by 30 June 2020. Looking at Phase One, this target would be achieved but it will certainly be complex. SITA required steady collaboration between DHET and Umalusi to make this possible and each stakeholder has been assigned its role in the business model. Umalusi reported that it was at the end of the value chain amongst the stakeholders and therefore not responsible for the backlog. Its mandate is solely providing quality assurance and certification of datasets submitted by DHET. If the datasets submitted were correct, its turnaround times would be reduced significantly, otherwise the datasets are sent back for the colleges to correct. Members asked how long the DHET has been using the 12 examination cycles and if it was possible for this to be reviewed; who exactly was responsible for the backlog; outreach campaigns on the certification process undertaken; why the CSIR was not appointed for the development of the IEITS; if SITA had an innovation partnership with CSIR; Umalusi turnaround times for consolidation of datasets; reasons for the seeming increase in backlog statistics; colleges failing to provide the data for certification; challenges in the legacy IT system; and if exam paper leakage had been resolved. Members wanted to know who was responsible for the development of the IEITS; if DHET had capacity to deal with the data from Community Education and Training (CET) and TVET colleges for migration to SITA and Umalusi; why SITA was placed under administration; if SITA had the capacity to handle the Day Zero commitment and exam cycle turnaround times; if consequence management has been implemented for those responsible for the backlog. Members were not happy that the stakeholders had taken so long to solve the certification backlog and asked why the service provider contracted to develop the new system had taken five years. However, there was satisfaction regarding the tangible commitments made and the timeline put in place to reduce the backlog. Meeting report The Chairperson noted that the Committee had visited the State Information Technology Agency (SITA) two weeks previously to get a sense of the certification backlog. The Committee and SITA agreed that answers would be provided today, particularly when Day Zero will come for the printing of certificates. The newly appointed SITA Administrator is also present and that is appreciated. SITA had been placed under administration since the start of the year. Certificate Status: TVET, CET, Private Colleges: DHET briefing Ms Violet Tshetlo, DHET Chief Director: National Examinations and Assessment (TVET, CET and Private Colleges), explained that certification backlog is defined as all eligible candidates who met the certification requirements but were not yet issued with certificates within three months from results approved by Umalusi. Thus anything after March constitutes a backlog for exams written in November/December. The Department runs 12 examinations cycles in an academic year. November and December are peak months for the certification process. She reported to the Committee on: • Progress and status of the certification backlog statistics • Key obstacles to eliminating the certification backlogs • Certification backlog Roll out Plan aimed at addressing the obstacles • Update on progress of the new Integrated Exams IT System (IEITS) • Challenges experienced in the development and deployment of the IEITS. The statistics fluctuate due to the following reasons: - SITA is busy refining the scripts and system certification backlog. - Instability of the examination information system to process the eligible candidates for certification. - 2019 August exam cycle outstanding certificates have been included in the backlog totals as they now meet the certification backlog's criteria - Candidates who had outstanding raw marks in the previous report to Committee which have since been summated by TVET colleges who are now eligible for certification are included in the totals - Candidates who had irregularities in the previous report and have since been cleared by the irregularity committee and now eligible for certification are included in the totals DHET spoke about the new exam system, the Integrated Examinations Information Technology System (IEITS) that it has been working on with a private service provider. Currently, system requirements and specifications for NC(V) L2 and NATED N4-N6 examination process have been documented and tested with the user community and Umalusi. The focus is now on finalisation of the interfaces with key stakeholders such as Umalusi, SAQA, SITA, Print Bureau, Department of Home Affairs, Department of Labour and other departments. The deployment of the new solution is planned to be implemented in a staggered approach per qualification over four months to ensure business continuity. It is envisaged that deployment will now commence in August 2020. It has been moved from June to August due to comprehensive quality gates for Functional Acceptance Testing (FAT). SITA commitment to Backlog Day Zero and its role in the New Exam System Mr Vernon John, Head of Department: Administration – Acting at SITA, reported that the pace of reduction will be ramped up in the next few weeks. It will look much better due to the revised approach that has been adopted. SITA’s approach included a multi-face approach with phase one looking at data analysis alignment. The phase 2 focus will be more on deep data analysis and cleansing, using a more modern technology. This is the work that will be done outside the historical system. Besides the technology, SITA will appoint a dedicated programme manager with focused programme resources that will be crossed utilised and rolled over to work on activities where quicker reduction benefits can be achieved. He noted that not everything will be resolved by the system and records that cannot be resolved by the system must be resolved through business solutions. The first prize will be Backlog Day Zero is achieved before the new system is implemented. There are dedicated DHET and SITA officials that will be allocated to the Backlog Day Zero programme. There will also be swift dataset turnaround time by all stakeholders and for resolving candidate records that have not been approved by Umalusi. [See slide 7 for a target timeline diagram on Backlog Day Zero] SITA projected that there will be about 80% reduction of the backlog by 30 June 2020. Looking at Phase One, this is going to be achieved but it will certainly be complex. SITA requires steady collaboration between DHET and Umalusi to make this possible and each stakeholder has been assigned its role on the business model (see slide 12 for DHET, SITA and Umalusi responsibilities). The role of SITA in the new system includes: - Providing advice and information on the current exam system to DHET service provider - Extracting data from current exam system and make it available to DHET service provider to port it to the new exam system - Hosting new exam system on the SITA cloud infrastructure, and - Change management and training services. SITA will not be rendering services such as system maintenance and enhancement services and functional application support services. However, SITA will ensure that there is proper governance at the ground level. SITA will report on a monthly basis to provide updates on the reduction of the backlog certification as Day Zero is looming. In conclusion, Mr John said that SITA executives are committed to reducing the backlog in collaboration with DHET and Umalusi. The Chairperson appreciated that they were now getting a sense of the commitments and Day Zero has now been announced and the Committee will be monitoring the status. My Luvuyo Keyise, SITA Executive Caretaker and Accountability Authority, added that there are now 33 dedicated technical resources to get the job done. There is a new software solution which is basically an easier database to get the work done for DHET to stop talking about the legacy system. The data from the legacy system will now be migrated to the new database to clear the backlog. The commitment is that at least minimum two weeks before going live with each module, the backlog should have been cleared. This is because going live on the new system with a backlog will mess it up. The commitment is minimum two weeks but it could be a month or two months earlier. That is the monthly reporting that will be provided through the Department. The additional technical resources and the new database will make a big difference. Umalusi on certification Prof John Volmink, Umalusi Council Chairperson, noted that there had been some improvements in the past year, particularly in the quality of the question papers as well as the improved preparedness of the markers. This led to a better engagement during the marking guideline discussion. On the certification mandate, Umalusi issues certificates to all deserving candidates. To this end each certificate must be issued with correct information. The grace period is allowed after the results have been released and during that period a candidate can enquire on their marks and re-checking of the scripts can take place and consolidation done to ensure that the correct marks are captured. It is after this process that certification process takes place. In conclusion, Umalusi has entered into a new service agreement with the Government Printing Works to provide Umalusi with certificate background paper for the period up to 2021. So far, Umalusi has received 500 000 certificate background papers for and it is expecting another 500 000 at the end of February. The order for 2021 has already been submitted. There are some challenges with some private colleges that have not been able to pay Umalusi for the certificates. These private colleges are not part of the backlog statistics. Individual candidates have an opportunity to pay Umalusi directly to receive their certificate. To resolve this problem, the college registration fees should include the certification fee to ensure students are not disadvantaged by the college being in arrears. On the certificate backlog, Dr Eva Sujee, Umalusi Senior Manager: Qualifications, Certification and Curriculum, reported that Umalusi processes datasets when they are received and so there is usually no backlog on datasets received. Dr Sujee stated that Umalusi must protect and ensure the integrity of the qualifications on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). Stringent quality assurance measures are in place to ensure the quality of data. Umalusi will continue to process and quality assure all requests for certification with due diligence. Umalusi is committed to support DHET and SITA in solving the problems preventing the certification of candidates. The Chairperson noted that the situation is now much better than when the Committee visited the SITA offices two weeks ago. He felt that the Committee was now getting clear answers on when Day Zero will come to fruition and how that process will be achieved. He thanked the SITA Administrator for the work that has been done so far. He would like DHET to give assurance that come March and August 2021 the system will be deployed. He was worried that the system has been under development for a long time. It cannot take five years to develop a system that is bespoke for the certification backlog. He did not understand why it was delayed so much. The Committee had scrutinised the Legacy Report of the previous Portfolio Committee. That committee was also concerned about this matter. He sought a firm commitment from the Department and advised that the service provider should be made aware of this so that there are no delays from the service providers’ side. Discussion Ms J Mananiso (ANC) asked how long DHET has been using the 12 examination cycles and if it was possible for this to be reviewed. It has been identified as leading to the backlog. On slide 6, SITA has assisted in addressing the backlog challenges but there is misalignment in the presentation about who exactly is responsible for what. On slide 7, it seems DHET is good at identifying problems but it moves at a very slow pace to resolve the problems. On slide 8, memos have been issued to colleges but it is unclear how the backlog will be dealt with at college level. There is a lack of outreach programmes and marketing to spread the word that certificates are available when dealing with the backlog. She asked if DHET had approached the CSIR when procuring the IT system. She asked if there are any partnerships with CSIR insofar as innovation. To Umalusi, she was concerned about the turnaround time for the consolidation of marks and asked about the turnaround time. Mr P Keetse (EFF) said a disruption is when a learner or student fails to get their certificate for 25 years. There are new interventions that have been commanded but what often happens is that the officials coming to Parliament are not the same officials that are on the ground. Members should not be undermined in terms of knowing what actually happens on the ground. He questioned the capacity and its effectiveness to reduce the backlog. Based on the statistics, it seems that it has increased instead of decreasing. This is clear from the statistics provided. Members were informed that has the capacity to print one million certificates in a day provided that DHET has provided the data. If that was the case, he did not believe that the backlog would have been a problem if the officials were being honest. He asked which colleges were not providing the data required by DHET so certificates can be printed. On the legacy system, he asked if the problems with the system were systemic and how it is affecting the backlog. Umalusi has come to the Committee before and submitted there was leaking of exam papers in TVET colleges. Mr Keetse believed this problem is still on-going. He asked to what extent paper leakages have been resolved, if it has been resolved? Lastly, there should be a thorough diagnosis of where the problem really is. From the presentations, there is no accountability and clarity on from where exactly the problem comes. Officials were being ‘wishy-washy’ about the truth. Mr B Nodada (DA) suggested that the Committee should invite Resolve IT to ascertain the delays in the implementation of the system. There are TVET colleges that have complained at ground level about the IT systems that they use to capture data. We speak of the Fourth Industrial Revolution but yet government departments cannot get the basics right such as system migration of data from one stakeholder to the other. Entities should not give the picture they think the Committee wants to see. The Committee needs to be told what the real problems are so that the next time the entities come, the Committee is able to scrutinise them based on the real problems previously presented and if solutions have resolve those identified problems. He asked about who is responsible for the examinations IT system. Does DHET have the internal capacity to deal with the certifications that come from CET and TVET colleges for processing before going to SITA and Umalusi? He asked Umalusi what the backlog is to consolidate the certification based on the records that it keeps since 1992. The same question applied to SITA. He wanted to know why SITA was under administration and if there is capacity in ICT processing, primarily human capacity, to handle the four examinations cycle within the three months that had been indicated. Lastly, what consequence management from all the stakeholders (DHET, Umalusi and SITA) has been implemented as far as where we are with the backlog? DHET Response Ms Aruna Singh, DHET Acting Deputy Director-General: Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), said that the cycle has been in operation for a long time, as long as the qualification has been around. The only new cycle or qualification is the National Certificate Vocational. DHET has managed this over a long period of time. On the communication and notification about certificates becoming available, this information is publicised where the interventions affect particular stakeholders. For example, DHET would publicise that students should go to the examination centres to get their certificates as opposed to the college head office, because the process requires you to go to the exam centre. The reason being is that doing this through colleges has borne a big gap, in some instances. Due to the lack of communication by colleges, DHET has been informed that some certificates have been at the exam centres for up to six months. Therefore, it is critical that the communication channels amongst the stakeholders are strengthened because it ends up affecting the students. On the IT system procurement, even if the CSIR wanted to come on board it would have to do so through the bidding process due to the magnitude of the project and its cost. It went out on an open tender process and the CSIR was also eligible to bid. In the November 2019 examination, there were no exam paper leakages and this was publicised. As for sharing the blame, it is important to note that this process does require everybody to work together. However, between DHET and SITA, we can accept portions of the blame. Even if one segment of the process works perfectly, you would not get a certificate until the entire value chain had no loopholes. Ms Tshetlo replied that DHET does have human capacity and has a dedicated team that will run with the qualification and they deal with the regions. That capacity is adequate for the current examinations and the current qualifications. However, that may not be the case in the future if more qualifications and examinations are added without adjusting the available capacity to cater for that. As for CETs, the General Education and Training Certificate (GETC) qualification is run on an agency basis at the provinces and there is support from SITA. It is a collaborative effort between DHET and the SITA. The ICT system for DHET was supported by SITA and it was based on the SITA main frame. It is run from SITA. On the DHET procurement of the IT system, it was done through an open tender assisted by SITA. The service provider that was sourced came through that process. SITA Response Mr Keyise explained the increased certification backlog statistics on slide 6 of the DHET presentation, particularly on the National Accredited Technical Education Diploma (NATED): Engineering Studies. There was a 1 858 increase in the backlog. However, the statistics do not show within the four month difference when the date was extracted, how many of the new data was received and how many was reduced. The reduction, however, was not shown. As for partnering with CSIR, both SITA and CSIR will soon come to the Committee and brief it on some of the innovative initiatives that the two are planning to partner in. CSIR has research capacity and SITA will report to the Committee on the research work planned ahead. It is indeed true that the systems in DHET, TVET colleges, SITA and Umalusi do not really talk to each other. There is no simpler integration of the government systems. The business rules have not been cleaned yet in terms of making that possible; it is a legacy problem of government. Old systems are used but the business rules have not been changed to make life easier and we are now reactive in solving the challenge. It is not being solved holistically to ensure that once it is fixed from a departmental level, it trickles down to the TVET college level. We are now going to move data from a legacy system into a new system that fits with the technology advances of today. This means that you can process the analysis of that data quicker and it can be done with minimal resources. Broadly the partnership with CSIR speaks to applied research on 4IR in simple terms. We want to partner and see how we can develop a localised ICT research. SITA will also be working with CSIR to build a cyber security academy and ensuring that there are internal skills based in government to refrain from going to the private sector all the time. On Resolve IT, SITA will also be analyzing why it took so long for the service provider to develop the system. SITA is not responsible and it is not playing any role in the implementation of that system. The system implementation is between DHET and Resolve IT. SITA’s job is to ensure that the data is cleaned and managed and moved into that system. SITA will avail itself in assisting to monitor the new system implementation in addition to the 33 technical staff that SITA will be utilising. There is no contractual relationship at this point. On SITA’s capacity to print a million documents a day, the challenge is not on the printing side but receiving the data or results from the TVET colleges. SITA has given Umalusi a five-working-days turnaround time so that it can move ahead with the process. Mr Keyise replied that he was not the right person to respond to why SITA was placed under administration. He was appointed after the fact but he would inform the Minister that the Committee had asked why the Agency was placed under administration. On consequence management at SITA, this will be looked into but not for the implementation of the new system because SITA is not responsible for that. Umalusi Response Dr Mafu Rakometsi, Umalusi Chief Executive Officer, said that advocacy is something that is continuous at the organisation. He assured Members that he runs road shows throughout the country as well as career exhibitions. The Council receives a report on this matter of how Umalusi executes its advocacy campaign or mandate. On the reduction of the turnaround times, the challenge is always about errors contained in the data submitted to Umalusi. If the data could be correct, the turnaround times would be significantly reduced. When it is not correct, Umalusi sends it back with reasons why the certification could not proceed. The leakage of question papers is mainly an issue that ought to be dealt with by DHET not Umalusi. Umalusi is not the custodian of the question papers and it provides only quality assurance. Also Umalusi cannot verify a student unless the correct data has been submitted. Umalusi verifies the integrity of the data submitted for certification and it is at the end of the value chain of the certification process. Umalusi relies on the quality of data that is submitted by the DHET and SITA. The organisation does not participate in the Department’s operations or implementation of the system. Its responsibility is to certify the data submitted by DHET; therefore, it cannot make confessions about matters it is not responsible for. Deputy Minister Response Mr Buti Manamela, Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training, said that addressing the certificate backlog is at the top of the agenda. DHET is always inundated about the delays in issuing the certificates. Secondly, DHET handles a number of examinations per year, as opposed to the Department of Basic Education which handles only one examination. So the point around Day Zero means that we can only address the backlog we have since the 1990s. However, there are challenges were people think they qualified and demand to be certificated. This is encompassed by all the other challenges. Continual reports will be furnished to the Committee based on the set targets as we approach Day Zero. The Chairperson said that he was happy with the Day Zero commitments. The Committee will hold DHET accountable for these commitments. He would have liked to see DHET making similar commitments as SITA had. The TVET and Community Education and Training (CET) colleges are the most neglected in the Post-School Education and Training (PSET) sector. The universities seem to be the top priority.

Recruitment Team 
SSCL – delivering services in partnership with the Metropolitan Police Service

Disability Confident Statement 
We view diversity as fundamental to our success. To tackle today’s complex policing challenges, we need a workforce made up from all communities that we serve. The Met’s diversity ambition is to create a workforce that looks and feels like London. We will police better and have better trust and engagement with the public if we reflect the communities we serve. Applications from across the community are therefore essential. We particularly welcome applications from ethnic minority groups and females.

As a Disability Confident employer, the Met has committed to making disability equality part of our everyday practice. We are committed to being an inclusive employer with a diverse and representative workforce at all levels and ensuring that disabled people and those with long term health conditions have the opportunities to fulfil their potential and realise their aspirations.
The organisation is committed to providing additional support and adjustments where appropriate to enable people with disabilities to feel more inclusive and have greater accessibility and equality of opportunity at work.
If you consider yourself to have access, workplace or reasonable adjustment requirements that need to be accommodated, we ask that you include this information within your application form. Professional advice (medical or otherwise) related to a request for access and adjustment needs will be sought in most cases. All matters will be treated in strict confidence and will not affect any recruitment decisions.
Should you indicate that you wish for us to consider a reasonable adjustment or access request, we will work with you and your line manager, where necessary, in conjunction with a medical, specialist, or professional advisor. This is to develop suitable adjustments where appropriate, and to enable equality of opportunity for success in the assessment process.
Please note, if you are applying for a police officer role or to become a police community support officer (PCSO) or designated detention officer (DDO), there is a minimum requirement that you must pass a job-related fitness test (JRFT). The core rationale for the JRFT is to ensure that prospective police officers have a minimum level of fitness to be able to undertake Public Safety Training (PST) training. Find out more about police fitness standards.

Agility
The Agility workstream is focused on deployment, monitoring and maintenance. These are typically IT-led efforts that rely heavily
on understanding the broader technical requirements and overall business strategy.
Based on your assessment results, here are your personalized recommendations and next steps.
Commitment: Agility
L O W H I G H
Commitment to agility
Data-driven organisations don’t just pay lip service to the importance of having an agile and high-performing Tableau
environment. They fully commit to realising the value of their Tableau environment – not just deploying Tableau Server or
Tableau Cloud, but investing in people, processes and technology to monitor and maintain a modern analytics platform.
This commitment is evident in all aspects of the organisation – from organisational structure to day-to-day processes. There is an
assigned executive who is accountable for the Tableau environment, ensuring that analytics projects tie back to critical business
efforts.

leaders determine topics that may need more attention in training or with engagement activities.
1. Review the Tableau discussion forums and chat section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Identify any existing infrastructure you can leverage for your discussion forum.
3. Explore the Tableau forums for inspiration on topics to feature and how to organise the forum.
4. Define a process to include answers to frequently asked questions in other enablement efforts.
Start a Tableau user group
During user group meetings, people can openly share information across different teams and departments. Regardless of skill
level, it’s a great way for everyone who attends to learn, network with other users and exchange fresh perspectives on solving
business problems with data.
1. Review the Tableau user group section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Establish a cadence for Tableau user group meetings and decide on a forum for meetings (in-person, virtual or hybrid).
3. Set an agenda for the meeting, sourcing ideas from the Tableau Blueprint, your Tableau discussion forum and public
Tableau user groups.
4. Encourage users to volunteer as guest speakers. Ask them to talk through use cases so the broader community can
appreciate the art of the possible.
5. Send an invitation to all Tableau users.
6. Cross-promote your Tableau User Group meeting across all community channels.
Schedule a lunch-and-learn series
Lunch & learn events are an informal option to help users develop skills ranging from successfully viewing and interacting with
data to building high availability into Tableau Server deployments.
1. Review the Tableau Lunch & Learn section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Schedule a recurring monthly meeting, no longer than one hour.
3. Identify a topic for each lunch & learn. You can crowdsource topics from your Tableau Forum, or ask your Tableau
Champions or Tableau Data Doctors to provide ideas based on what they're seeing amongst users.
4. Leverage free training videos on Tableau.com.
5. Send an invitation to all Tableau users, and allow others to join as well.
6. Cross-promote your lunch & learn series across all community channels.
Plan for an annual Tableau Day or Analytics Day
A Tableau Day (otherwise known as an Analytics Summit or Analytics Day) helps raise the visibility of data and analytics within
your company, highlight examples of how data has had transformational impact, teach users new skills, and more.
1. Review the Tableau Day section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Establish a working team to help plan and execute the event.
3. Define the outcomes you want to achieve (e.g. learn about use cases, appreciate the transformational impact of data,
develop new skills).
4. Create an outcomes-oriented agenda. At a minimum, you should include: an executive welcome, user-
provided success stories (use cases) from around the organization, Tableau how-to sessions, and Data Doctor
sessions.
5. Make the event fun! Provide Tableau swag to users, make the event interactive with polls or surveys, and more!
6. Reach out to your Tableau account team if you want help planning and delivering a Tableau Day.
Encourage users to join public Tableau user groups
Public Tableau user groups provide an opportunity for like-minded data rockstars to meet with one another. Regardless of skill
level, it’s a great way for everyone who attends to learn, network with other users and exchange fresh perspectives on solving
business problems with data.
1. Review the Area Tableau user group section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Encourage users to join public Tableau user groups where there is an opportunity to do so.
3. Cross-promote public Tableau user groups across all community channels.
Encourage users to participate in Tableau Public virtual challenges
Run by the Tableau Community, these events inspire others, demonstrate different ways to solve problems and offer different
perspectives for applying Tableau. This includes well-established activities like Makeover Monday and Workout Wednesday,
among others.
1. Review the Tableau Public virtual challenges section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Cross-promote Tableau Public virtual challenges across all community channels.
3. Provide users with time to participate in these community-led events.
4. Create opportunities to bring users together (like your Tableau User Group) to discuss their learnings afterwards. This
will help encourage mutual learning and celebrate individual success.
Send users to Tableau Conference
People come to Tableau Conferences to learn new Tableau skills, find inspiration, network with other attendees and build
lasting connections. It's important that your employees be a part of this experience so they can kick their skills into high gear.
1. Review the Tableau Conference section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Build a plan to send people to Tableau Conference – from authors and analysts, to executive sponsors and data
stewards, to server architects and site administrations.
3. In between Tableau Conferences, leverage content from previous years as part of your community communications,
engagement and support efforts.
4. Encourage enthusiastic Tableau users to apply to speak at Tableau Conference to help develop their leadership skills
and knowledge around topics such as your organisation's use case.
Launch a formal Tableau Champions programme
A Tableau Champions programme identifies and elevates super users, helping them realise their greatest potential while also
enlisting them as leaders, teachers and advocates of data culture in your organisation’s community. This is vital for your
adoption process because as your deployment expands to new departments and teams, new champions will need to be
developed to support the scaling of your analytics practice.
1. Review the Tableau champion development section of Tableau Blueprint for inspiration.
2. Define the scope of your formal Tableau Champions programme. Consider including Tableau Data Doctor as a key
part of the program.
3. Based on your scope, first design your programme by defining the Tableau Champion role and thinking through how
you will develop and reward them.
4. Once the programme has been designed, make a plan to run your Tableau Champions programme, including
branding, identifying champions, and day-to-day operations.
5. Create an email alias or chat group (like a Slack channel) for these individuals to make it easy for them to collaborate
with each other.
Start a Tableau champions group
Champions should meet as a group to share what they are hearing and seeing from users to feed into community-wide
enablement activities, representing the Tableau community within your organisation.
1. Review the Tableau champions group section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Establish your champions programme.
3. Establish a cadence for champions group meetings and decide on a forum for meetings (in-person, virtual or hybrid).
4. Define a process to review concerns and ideas that are raised in other enablement efforts.
Establish a business leader steering committee
Executive sponsors serve as the governing body for the use of Tableau, setting the vision for modern analytics. Executive
sponsors should meet on a regular cadence to accomplish their collective duty.
1. Review the Tableau project team roles and responsibilities section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Identify the executive sponsors in your organisation.
3. Define the purpose and scope of your business leader steering committee as well as a meeting cadence.
Define escalation paths
In addition to the proactive steps you have taken with self-service help resources and education initiatives published on your
enablement intranet, your user community should be able to request more support in case these two approaches do not
answer their questions or resolve the issue.
1. Review the Tableau support processes section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Identify the types of support requests you're currently receiving from users (e.g. feature/function, data connectivity,
where to find information, etc.).
3. Determine the escalation path users should follow to get help if they have questions related to these topics.
4. Promote self-service help options (e.g. Tableau discussion forum) as your users' first line of defence.
5. Create a process for users to escalate issues if need be to Tableau administrators who generally have Tableau case
management rights.
6. Document this information and post it to your enablement intranet.
Leverage technology to manage support cases
Larger organisations may want to leverage a ticket management system or other technology to more formally manage help
requests.
1. Review the Tableau support processes section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Review your organisation's current volume of support requests to determine if a formal system is necessary.
3. Identify any existing infrastructure you can leverage to manage support cases.
4. If you implement a tracking system, document this information and post it to your enablement intranet.
Log and categorise support requests
Help requests are powerful data points. Through analysis, you can determine common issues that users face and use this
information to inform user enablement content, Tableau User Group topics, etc. In other words, a regular review of support
escalations is a source of user feedback than can be leveraged to expedite user proficiency and/or escalate and resolve
previously unidentified user/system issues.
1. Review the Tableau support processes section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Log and categorise support requests so they can be easily analysed.
3. Review the data with Tableau Champions and Executive Sponsors during regularly scheduled meetings to inform

Personal Finance Award SCQF Level 6
•	Course 
•	Competencies 
•	More

Welcome to the Personal Finance - Level 6 
Learner Study Dashboard, fiston
Introduction
This pack is designed for learners studying the Level 6 Personal Finance Award. The Award is made up of two units:

1.  Money Management
2.  Personal Finance in Action

To gain the Award learners must achieve both units. 

Once learners have studied the content of the units, they will sit their final assessments via SQA’s on screen assessment system (SOLAR). 

This pack is intended to help learners become familiar with the terms used in financial products and services and understand more about how they work and what they are used for before they sit their final assessment. Questions included in the final assessment will draw from the content of units one and two.

Learners can use the explanations and descriptions given within this pack as a starting point for further investigation into the various topics covered, or they can use it as a reminder of the various topics covered. 

PLEASE NOTE

Where terms are defined in this document by giving examples of specific values that might apply, the values given are usually based on 2021-22 rates. For example: VAT; Income Tax Bands; Land and Buildings Transaction Tax rates; ISA savings limit; Capital Gains Tax threshold; etc. Learners must be aware that the government has the authority to increase or decrease tax and threshold rates each year depending on inflation and other economic, societal or political factors.

Lesson 1 of 12
Background — How did we get here? 
 
Given the extent of change in the education, skills and employment landscape since the HN Qualifications were last reviewed and revised, we ran a consultation between February 2018 and March 2019 on how to reshape and transform them for the future. 
The consultation included extensive engagement with colleges, sector skills bodies, Skills Development Scotland (SDS), the Scottish Funding Council and other stakeholders.
The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) at Higher National Certificate (HNC) at SCQF level 7 and Higher National Diploma (HND) at SCQF level 8 are vital for many learners, creating opportunities in both education and employment. It is important that the NextGen: HN qualifications are innovative, creative, dynamic, flexible and resilient, and serve as key enablers to both further study and work. 
We considered the current position of HN Qualifications, using service design elements to collate ideas and opportunities to develop world-class, ambitious qualifications that will meet the needs of learners, education and industry.

1 Introduction
This document was previously known as the Arrangements Document. The purpose of this
document is to:
• assist centres to implement, deliver, and manage the qualification
• provide a guide for new staff involved in offering the qualification
• inform course managers, teaching staff, assessors, learners, employers, and Higher
Education institutions of the aims and purpose of the qualification
• provide details of the range of learners that the qualification is suitable for and the
progression opportunities
This document has been written in order to assist centres in preparing for approval of the new
SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards and
maintaining the awards thereafter. These two awards were developed under the new SQA
Design Principles, were validated in March 2005, and replace the existing SQA Advanced
Certificate in Engineering: Electrical and the SQA Advanced Diploma in Engineering: Electrical.
This document includes details on the background to the development of the new awards, their
aims (both general and specific), recommended access requirements, information about the
structure of the awards, recommendations on delivery and assessment and other guidance for
centres.
2 Rationale for the revisions of the awards
2.1 Electrical Engineering
The term Electrical Engineering in the context of this document covers the range of subjects
traditionally included in SQA Advanced Qualifications in Electrical Engineering, namely power,
plant and electrical installation. The title Electrical Engineering is intended to provide
candidates, lecturers, Higher Education, employers and professional bodies with a clear,
unambiguous title.
Electronics has not been included in the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
Diploma in Electrical Engineering titles as only sufficient electronics has been included in both
awards to underpin studies in the various branches of electrical engineering.
2.2 SQA Advanced Engineering Frameworks
In 1996 the SQA validated nationally a large number of new SQA Advanced Engineering
awards including two awards entitled SQA Advanced Certificate in Engineering: Electrical and
SQA Advanced Diploma in Engineering: Electrical. A major difference between these and
previous awards were that they all sat within an SQA Advanced Engineering Framework which
in general terms consisted, for both SQA Advanced Certificates and SQA Advanced Diplomas,
of a common core of units (units common to all SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
Diploma in Engineering awards), a principles/technology and optional sections. The benefits of
this Framework structure were seen to include the following:
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 2
• provide a wide range of SQA Advanced Engineering qualifications to meet the needs of
different engineering sectors
• improve the credibility and esteem of individual SQA Advanced Engineering awards
• clarify those competencies that were general to all incorporated engineers and those that
were specific to particular engineering disciplines
• provide opportunities for the efficient delivery of SQA Advanced Engineering units by, for
example, incorporating units that were common to a number of different SQA Advanced
awards
• facilitate better progression between SQA Advanced Certificate, SQA Advanced Diploma
and degree engineering awards
Prior to the development of any SQA Advanced Engineering awards a major consultation
exercise was undertaken on the overarching SQA Advanced Engineering Framework to test the
validity of the Framework. This consultation comprised of the following five strands:
• a questionnaire survey with stakeholders of SQA Advanced Engineering awards
• a series of meetings with various interested stakeholders of SQA Advanced Engineering
awards
• desk based research
• discussions (followed by endorsement) of a proposed SQA Advanced Engineering
Framework at an SQA Advanced Engineering Steering Group meeting
• a major consultation event with FE colleges on 24 May 2002 which included a
questionnaire survey
The consultation revealed continuing strong support for an overarching SQA Advanced
Engineering Framework but with the following modifications:
• a reduction in the number of common core units
• a strengthening of the Principles/Technology section with an even stronger emphasis on
the teaching of core engineering principles and technologies
Optional sections are retained in all SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
Engineering awards.
The revised SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Engineering
Frameworks are shown in block diagram form in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. It should be noted that the
PDAs shown in both diagrams may be developed as more SQA Advanced units come on
stream; currently none of these PDAs exist.

2.3 History and market research to support the SQA Advanced
Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
2.3.1 History of the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in
Electrical Engineering awards
The introduction of the SCOTVEC Advanced Courses Development Programme lead
to the replacement of the 132 SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical and Electronic
Engineering award by a competence based SQA Advanced Diploma in Electronic and
Electrical Engineering in 1989. Shortly after an SQA Advanced Certificate in Electronic
and Electrical Engineering was introduced as part of a national development and
replaced the 101 SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
However, there continued to be little commonality between the new SQA Advanced
Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma awards. The first attempt to harmonise the two
awards took place as part of a consortium development in the early nineties. In 1995
and 1996 the two awards were totally harmonised (eg the SQA Advanced Certificate in
Electrical Engineering becoming effectively the first year of the SQA Advanced
Diploma) as part of a major SCOTVEC national development which saw the
introduction of an overarching SQA Advanced Engineering Framework. The two new
awards represent a further development of SQA Advanced Engineering awards taking
full account the new SQA Advanced Design Principles and providing an opportunity to
update the awards in light of technological and educational developments.
2.3.2 Market research
The development of the new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
in Electrical Engineering awards included extensive market research which is
summarised below in Table 2.3.
Table 2.3
Stakeholder Method
All Major desk based research gathering and analysing
data from various sources (eg SEMTA, FutureSkills
Scotland, etc).
Delivery Centres Initial postal survey of all delivery centres followed by
two National seminars.
Draft units, assessment exemplars and outlines of
graded units were made available to centres.
Employers Surveys of employers were carried out at the
commencement of the development of the two
awards and when the two award structures and units
were nearing finalisation. Information obtained from
employers helped to inform both structure and unit
development.
Higher Education Letters of support for articulation between the new
SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
Diploma in Electrical Engineering and degree awards
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 6
were received from seven Higher Education
institutions.
Professional Bodies The Chair of the Institute of Incorporated Engineers
was a member of the Validation Panel and provided a
broad measure of support for the two new
developments at the Validation Event which was later
confirmed in writing.
Health and Safety
Executive
A representative from the Health and Safety
Executive provided some invaluable input into the
development of the Electrical Safety Unit and other
units with significant safety content.
Students While not consulted directly the student experience of
the current SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
Advanced Diploma in Engineering: Electrical was
taken fully into account in the new developments.
2.4 Candidates
2.4.1 SQA Advanced Certificate Candidates
Candidates at SQA Advanced Certificate level may already be in employment and will
attend centres on a day-release or other part-time basis. The SQA Advanced
Certificate framework structure is flexible enough to allow centres to deliver the SQA
Advanced Certificate award by various modes of delivery for example, two-year day-
release, evening attendance etc.
The options chosen by employed candidates may reflect the branch of industry in
which they are employed or may be used to gain knowledge of other areas within
electrical engineering in order to improve their career opportunities in the employment
market. Part-time candidates may also use the SQA Advanced Certificate award to
gain entry to degree level studies.
Full-time SQA Advanced Certificate candidates may be school leavers intending to
articulate to a university degree course, or candidates who wish to progress from an
appropriate National Certificate qualification. Full-time candidates may also be more
mature persons who are seeking a change of employment.
Since the SQA Advanced Certificate award forms an integral part of the SQA
Advanced Diploma award, full-time candidates will complete 15 unit credits in the first
year of the course, 12 of these meeting the SQA Advanced Certificate requirements.
In addition to university entrance, successful full-time SQA Advanced Certificate
candidates have enhanced their prospects of gaining employment in the Electrical
Engineering industry.
2.4.2 SQA Advanced Diploma Candidates
The SQA Advanced Diploma award programme will normally be delivered on a two-
year full-time basis, although this does not preclude other delivery patterns. This being
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 7
the case, SQA Advanced Diploma candidates may be school leavers who have an
interest in some aspect of electrical engineering and wish to include this in their career
path. This may be candidates who wish to progress from an appropriate National
Certificate qualification or candidates who have previously completed the SQA
Advanced Certificate award and wish to progress to the SQA Advanced Diploma. The
typical SQA Advanced Diploma candidate will therefore be a young person intending to
articulate to a university degree course. The units of the SQA Advanced
Certificate/Diploma framework have been designed to introduce candidates to
electrical engineering and to take topics to a more advanced level than is possible in
the SQA Advanced Certificate.
Mature candidates may also embark on the SQA Advanced Diploma programme. The
SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team and unit writers were aware that such
candidates may not have studied for some time and will require additional support in
developing their learning skills. The SQA Advanced Electrical units have been
designed as far as possible to provide candidates with opportunities to develop critical
knowledge and understanding of theory and practical hands-on skills required by
practising electrical incorporated engineers.

3.5 How the General Aims are met in the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma Award
Structures and Content
Aim no. How it is met in SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
3.1.1 For many years, SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering qualifications have equipped
candidates to seek employment in a wide range of manufacturing, service and public sector organisations. Market research indicates
that SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering Electrical Engineering awards are still regarded
as the minimum qualifications required by many organisations to work at electrical technician or incorporated engineer level.
3.1.2 There has been a long tradition of candidates in employment taking SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical and Electronic awards on
a part-time basis to increase their knowledge of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and enhance their career development. In
recent years, with increased commonality between SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
awards and greater flexibility in the way these awards are delivered, candidates in employment have increasingly taken SQA
Advanced Diplomas on a part-time basis to expand their knowledge and skills in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and improve
their career prospects. The two new awards contain a balance of core principles and up-to-date knowledge and skills in Electrical
Engineering which lends themselves to the Continuous Professional Development and career development of candidates working at
electrical technician and incorporated engineer levels. Furthermore, the award structures have been designed to allow for easy
progression between SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma awards.
3.1.3 All units within the new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards have been levelled
at SCQF levels 6, 7 or 8. The two new awards also conform to the SQA levelling requirements for SQA Advanced Certificate and
SQA Advanced Diploma awards. Thus, successful completion of one or both awards will allow progression within the SCQF.
3.1.4 The nature of Electrical Engineering as a discipline lends itself to both the analysis and synthesis of problems. For example, when a
complex electrical and electronic system is analysed (using, say, a block diagram approach) by breaking it down into separate
functional parts or alternatively the synthesis of a complex system from simpler electrical and electronic systems. The two new
awards allow these important skills to be developed further both in the technical subjects and in the core Communication, Information
Technology and Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development units.

Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 11
Aim no. How it is met in SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
3.1.5 The new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards provide centres with an
opportunity to enhance learning skills not least by creating opportunities for candidates to combine theory and practice to achieve
a real understanding of a subject. For example, some units recommend significant use of practical work and/or computer
simulation to reinforce learning. It is also anticipated that centres will use innovative delivery approaches that may make use of
sophisticated electrical and electronic laboratory equipment and/or online delivery and/or Virtual Learning Environments to
enhance candidate learning.
By their very nature Engineering courses require the transfer of technical knowledge and skills form one area to another. For
example, a significant level of Electrical Principles and Mathematics has been included in both SQA Advanced Certificate and
SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards because these subjects provide underpinning knowledge,
understanding and skills which are used elsewhere in both awards. Candidates will also have an opportunity to use the
Communication and Information Technology knowledge and skills developed in the mandatory core units in other parts of the
awards to support such activities as report writing, presentation and the application of specialist software packages. Core Skills in
general, and problem solving in particular, have been regarded as very important by the SQA Advanced Electrical Development
Team since it is recognised that a good level of competence in these is essential in the work of an incorporated electrical
technician.
3.3.1 The double credit (16 SCQF points) Engineering Project Graded Unit in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
award provides opportunities for candidates to develop both their planning and project management knowledge and skills.
3.3.2 The Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development Unit provides candidates with the opportunities to develop
their investigative skills by exploring the external and internal factors that affect the performance of a modern company and the
different ways that people learn. The Engineering Project also requires candidates to undertake some investigations into the
background to and a range of solutions for their engineering project.

3.6 How the Specific Aims are met in the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma Award
Structures and Content
Aim no. How it is met in SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
3.2.1 An SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award has been recognised for many years
by employers and other stakeholders of these awards as appropriate qualifications for persons wishing to work at electrical
technician or senior technician levels. Market research indicates that there is a growing demand for people with technician level
skills in electrical and electronic engineering especially as companies automate a lot more of their processes. Thus, it is
confidently anticipated that those achieving the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
awards will find employment as electrical technicians and incorporated electrical engineers in a wide range of small, medium and
large companies.
3.2.2
&
3.2.3
An SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in no longer satisfies fully the academic requirements for Incorporated
Engineer status although these qualifications continue to completely satisfy Engineering Technician requirements. The minimum
qualification for Incorporated Engineer is an ordinary degree.
Given the clear progression routes that have been established between existing SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards and degree courses by many FE colleges and universities, it is strongly anticipated that
similar progression routes will also be developed between the new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in
Electrical Engineering awards and degree courses. Thus, SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
Engineering awards will continue to form very important ‘stepping stones’ towards candidates achieving degrees (and, thus,
satisfy fully the academic requirements for Incorporated Engineer status). Progression arrangements between SQA Advanced
Certificates, SQA Advanced Diplomas and degrees can only be strengthened with the full implementation of the SCQF. Seven
letters have been received from Scottish Universities confirming articulation arrangements between the new SQA Advanced
Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards and degree programmes.

5.3 Graded Units
The purpose of the Graded Unit for both the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
Advanced Diploma awards is to assess the candidate’s ability to apply and integrate
knowledge and/or skills gained within individual units. By this means candidates will
demonstrate that they have achieved the specific aims of the awards as detailed in
Sections 3.2 and 3.4. The Graded Units also provide the means by which a candidate’s
achievement can be graded.
SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering candidates will undertake a one
Credit Graded Unit at level 7. This will be in the form of a 3-hour written examination.
SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering candidates will also do the SQA
Advanced Certificate Graded Unit but, in addition, will undertake a two Credit Graded
Unit at level 8. This will take the form of a practical assignment/project.
5.3.1 Types of Graded Units
SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 — Examination
It will be noted that the Graded Unit draws on Outcomes in the mandatory section of the
award which are studied by all SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering
candidates.
The assessment for the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 consists of an examination
paper which should last three hours.
It is recommended that candidates do not sit the Graded Unit examination until the end
of the SQA Advanced Certificate (1st Year of the SQA Advanced Diploma), given the
range of units that it draws from.
SQA Advanced Diploma Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 2 — Project
The nature of the project activity is such that it is likely that centres will wish their
candidates to embark on it from the start of the second year of the SQA Advanced
Diploma in Electrical Engineering programme. As it is anticipated that centres will deliver
the SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering as part of the first year of the
SQA Advanced Diploma, it is recommended that candidates have completed all SQA
Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering units, including the SQA Advanced
Certificate Graded Unit, before commencing the project.
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 19
In principle, the project can draw on any units in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
Engineering framework although the majority of units should be at SCQF level 8. The
project can be taken from one Electrical Engineering area (eg Electrical Machines) or it
can span more than one technical area. However, its principal purpose is not to integrate
technical content (this is covered in Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1) but rather to
combine such knowledge and skills as planning, construction, testing, evaluating and
reporting.
5.3.2 Rationale for the Graded Units Assessment
The assessment methods ie an examination for Graded Unit 1 and a project for Graded
Unit 2 were decided through consultation with industry and delivering centres during
initial consultation on the overarching SQA Advanced Engineering Framework (see SQA
Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electronics Validation Document
for more details).
The consultation indicated that an ‘examination’ provided a more accurate way of
assessing candidates’ abilities to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding from
various technical and related areas, such as Communication. Furthermore, it was
considered that during their SQA Advanced Certificate studies candidates will not
normally develop fully the necessary knowledge and skills to complete a project.
A project was preferred at the SQA Advanced Diploma level because a project-based
assignment provides candidates with opportunities to demonstrate not only their
knowledge and skills in a technical area(s) but also in areas such as planning,
construction, testing, evaluating and reporting which are important aims within the SQA
Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award.

5.5 Conditions of the Award
The conditions of award for SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in
Electrical Engineering qualifications are as follows:
5.5.1 SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering
A candidate will be awarded SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering on
successful completion of 11 unit credits plus 1 Graded Unit based on the SQA Advanced
Certificate in Electrical Engineering award structure shown in Section 5.1. More specifically
this award structure requires that a candidate achieves the following:
• the 1 unit credit Communication: Practical Skills within the mandatory section
• the remaining eight unit credits from the mandatory section
• two unit credits from the optional section
• Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 Examination
5.5.2 SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
A candidate will be awarded SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering on
successful completion of 27 unit credits plus 3 Graded Unit Assessment credits based on
the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award structure shown in Section 5.2.
More specifically this award structure requires that candidates achieve the following:
• the 3 unit credits Communication: Practical Skills, Information Technology:
Applications Software 1 and Business Awareness and Continuing Professional
Development within the mandatory section
• remaining 17 unit credits from the mandatory section
• seven unit credits from the optional section
• Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 and Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit
5.6 SCQF levels
Figures 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 show the distribution of SCQF levels in the SQA Advanced
Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards respectively in
the mandatory sections. It can be seen from Figure 5.6.1 that all units in the SQA
Advanced Certificate Electrical Engineering mandatory section are at level 7 except for
two, the Mathematics for Engineering 1: Electronic and Electrical Unit and the Application
of Electrical and Electronic Instruments Unit, which are both at level 6. The Table shows
that the number of SCQF level 7 units substantially exceeds the minimum of 48 SCQF
credit points required to be in an SQA Advanced Certificate to satisfy the new SQA
Advanced Design Principles.
From the outset of developments, the SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team
recognised that the level of Mathematics achieved by the average candidate entering the
current SQA Advanced Certificate in Engineering: Electrical award was around
Intermediate 2 (Standard Grade Credit level) and there was a need to include a SCQF
level 6 Mathematics Unit in the SQA Advanced Certificate] (and the first year of the SQA
Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering) which consolidated candidates’ existing
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 29
knowledge and understanding of Mathematics particularly in the areas of transposing and
solving equations and trigonometry, skills that are so important in the field of Electrical
Engineering.
The Application of Electrical and Electronic Instruments Unit was originally levelled at
SCQF level 7, but was relevelled at SCQF level 6 as a result of the validation process.
As noted above, the SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team has levelled the
remaining units in the mandatory section of the SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical
Engineering at SCQF level 7. The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team used as
their benchmarks for levelling, the Highers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and
various NQ Electronic and Electrical Engineering units and their knowledge of the content
of existing degree courses in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.
It can be seen from Figure 5.6.2 that the minimum number of SCQF level 8 units a
candidate has to take in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering is 64 SCQF
credit points which meets the minimum requirement of 64 SCQF credit points as stated in
the SQA Advanced Design Principles. However, it is anticipated that most candidates will
undertake some optional units at level 8 which will mean that they will comfortably exceed
this minimum requirement. The case for the two level 6 units in the SQA Advanced
Diploma in Electrical Engineering has already been presented above. A number of the
SCQF level 8 units in the SQA Advanced Diploma follow on from corresponding level 7
units and are, therefore, appropriately levelled at SCQF level 8. The SQA Advanced
Electrical Development Team also used their knowledge of existing second year degree
courses to level units in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award.

6 Approaches to delivery and assessment
6.1 Content and context
Throughout the design and development of the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards the SQA Advanced Electrical
Development Team has placed a high priority on producing awards that allow candidates
to develop appropriate technical and practical skills. As indicated earlier, it is not possible
to quantify such technical and practice skills in exact detail. However, the Development
Team has taken the view that the best way to prepare candidates to meet the changing
technical and practical requirements of the modern Electrical industry is to ensure
candidates have a solid foundation of theory and practice upon which they can build new
knowledge, understanding and skills. Thus, the mandatory section of the SQA Advanced
Certificate in Electrical Engineering contains fundamental studies in Electrical Principles,
Electrical Machines, Power Systems, Electrical Safety and Application of Instruments.
The SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical mandatory section builds on and extends these
studies. The studies in Electrical Engineering are underpinned by the inclusion of a core
Mathematics Unit in the SQA Advanced Certificate and two core Mathematics units in the
SQA Advanced Diploma. The SQA Advanced in Electrical Development Team believes
that a good grasp of mathematics is essential to the understanding of Electrical
Engineering.
The optional sections of both the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
in Electrical Engineering provide candidates with the opportunity to specialise in technical
and/or non-technical subjects. In line with normal good practice centres are encouraged
to advise candidates to choose those options that best meet their future career and
educational aspirations.
The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team has also ensured that the two new
awards contain opportunities for candidates to develop a range of related skills which
would make the holder of the awards better prepared for employment and/or degree
studies. For example, the Communication: Practical Skills Unit has been included within
the mandatory sections of both SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
awards to provide candidates with the opportunity to develop their written and group
discussion skills about complex vocational issues.
While a discrete Information Technology unit is no longer included within the SQA
Advanced Certificate mandatory section centres will still have the opportunity to access
such a unit via the optional section of the SQA Advanced Certificate (Information
Technology: Applications Software 1). Even where centres choose not to select this unit
from the optional section there are a number of opportunities to develop Information
Technology knowledge and skills within individual units. The Information Technology:
Applications Software 1 unit has been included within the core of the SQA Advanced
Diploma to allow centres to concentrate on business applications, such as word
processing, spreadsheets, databases, or engineering specific applications or a
combination of the two.
A new type of Business Studies unit, entitled Business Awareness and Continuing
Professional Development, has been included within the mandatory section of the SQA
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 31
Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering. This unit focuses on two areas which the
SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team considered important to working in the
modern electrical industry: namely the external and internal factors that affect business
performance and the need for continuing learning and development if candidates are to
have sustainable and rewarding employment in the future.
6.2 Delivery
The new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
Engineering awards can be delivered on a full-time, block-release, part-time day or part-
time evening basis.
In timetabling the two new awards, centre staff should take account of information
contained in the recommended prior knowledge and skills statement in unit specifications
in sequencing the delivery of units. For example, the Single Phase AC Circuits unit would
normally be delivered before the Electrical Networks and Resonance. Examples of a full-
time SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering and 2nd Year SQA Advanced
Diploma in Electrical Engineering timetables are shown in Appendix 1.
One of the key reasons the SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team has sought to
reduce the time candidates have to spend on summative unit assessment is to provide
lecturers with more time to deliver units. Lecturers are encouraged, in particular, to use
this additional time to reinforce learning in core electrical principles and technologies and
enhance the development of candidates’ practical electrical skills.
Lecturers may use a variety of teaching and learning approaches in delivering the units in
the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
awards. These may include lecturing, group work, laboratory and practical work,
computer simulation (using appropriate software packages), project work and case
studies. The use of open and distance learning and online materials may help to
supplement and support the learning that takes place in the classroom, laboratory or
workshop.
Industrial visits are encouraged wherever possible to provide ‘real life’ industrial
examples of the application of the theory and practice learned in the classroom,
laboratory or workshop.
The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team recognises the very important role
computer simulation, such as electrical installation software, plays in the modern
electrical industry. The Team would actively encourage the use of computer simulation
wherever appropriate but not at the expense of candidates doing practical work. The
Team believe it is very important that candidates get as much exposure as possible to
practical electrical hand skills, the use of electrical and electronic test equipment and
other practical electrical activities if they are to be suitably prepared to work in industry.
Lecturers should also seek opportunities to integrate Core Skills within their teaching and
learning programmes. Such opportunities may include the following:

From the outset of developments the SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team
recognised the need to have an appropriate assessment strategy in place for the
SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
awards. Such a strategy was developed and is shown below:
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 33
Aims
To ensure that:
(1) consistent, rigorous and efficient approaches are adopted to the development
and administration of SQA Advanced Electrical Engineering assessment
instruments at both Unit and Graded Unit levels, which satisfy nationally
agreed standards
(2) the assessment load on candidates and staff is sensible and that assessment
does not unduly detract from teaching and learning
(3) as far as possible reliable and rigorous moderation processes are put in
place in order to ensure that consistent national standards are achieved for
all SQA Advanced Electrical Engineering assessments
Objectives
Listed below are the measures that have been put in place to meet the aims:
(1) Develop nationally at least one assessment exemplar pack for each
mandatory unit, which clearly sets out the standards of assessment expected
in the unit.
(2) Adopt a holistic approach to unit assessment. The implications of this are as
follows:
(i) Assessment instruments will normally be designed only to sample
knowledge and skills in a unit (this is consistent with the new SQA
Advanced Unit format).
(ii) A unit assessment strategy will be adopted, where possible, to produce a
single assessment instrument for the whole unit. Where this is not
possible the assessment strategy will seek to ensure that the minimum
number of assessment instruments required are consistent with
maintaining agreed national standards.
(3) While not seeking to be entirely prescriptive with regard to the time spent on
assessment in each SQA Advanced Unit, over assessment should be
avoided. Assessment times are clearly stated in the individual unit
specifications.
(4) Produce assessment exemplar packs for the two Graded Units. For the
Graded Unit examination produce at least one sample exam paper to show
the standards expected in such a paper. Likewise, for the 2 Credit Graded
Unit Electrical Engineering Project produce a set of materials which clearly
set out the standards of candidate response required to achieve a Grade A
and a Grade C.
(5) Actively encourage centres to work in partnership in producing Graded Unit
assessment materials, which meet nationally agreed standards reducing, in
turn, the workload on staff in individual colleges.
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 34
(6) Ensure that consistent and rigorous internal and external moderation
procedures operate through both SQA Advanced Unit level and Integrative
Assessment processes. This places a clear responsibility on both centres
and the SQA.
As far as has been practical the above objectives have been adhered to when
developing assessment exemplar and Graded Unit materials.
Assessment Loading Grid
An Assessment Loading Grid showing the type and duration of assessment in each
unit is shown in Appendix 2. It is hoped that course planners will find this grid
helpful in timetabling the two awards.
Assessment Exemplar Materials
Assessment exemplar packs are in the process of being produced for all
mandatory units, and the Graded Units in the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards.
Graded Unit Assessment Exemplars
It is recommended that candidates do not sit the Graded Unit examination until the
end of the SQA Advanced Certificate (1st Year of the SQA Advanced Diploma)
given the range of units that it draws from. It is recommended that, given the size
and complexity of the project, that the Graded Unit project is started at the
beginning of the second year of the SQA Advanced Diploma.
Formative Assessment
Formative assessment should be used throughout the delivery of units to reinforce
learning, build candidates’ confidence and prepare candidates for summative
assessment.
6.4 Re-assessment
The way in which centres reassess candidates is integral to the way they manage
the award assessment process as a whole. Re-assessment should be subject to
rigorous internal moderation in exactly the same way as assessment is.
Candidates may require to be reassessed on only a part of an assessment where
their evidence has been generated over a period of time and/or a discrete part of
the unit, such as an Outcome, has been assessed originally. On other occasions in
may not be possible to reassess candidates on parts of their performance which
are unsatisfactory. Situations where candidates may have to re-do a whole
assessment include:
• assessments which test knowledge and understanding and where it may not be
possible to extract some of the items for re-assessment purposes
• where parts of several Outcomes are involved
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 35
• where a project has been designed as an integral assessment and where there
is requirement to complete the project as a single complex task
Re-assessment Opportunities
Re-assessment should operate in accordance with a centre’s assessment policy
and the professional judgement of the assessor. SQA advises that there should
normally be one, or in exceptional circumstances two, re-assessment opportunities.
Please refer to SQA’s Guide to Assessment and Quality Assurance for Colleges of
Further Education, August 2003 revisions.
Developing Alternative Assessments
The design of original assessments should inform the re-assessment process to a
large extent, as the original determines the type of assessment instruments used
and the purpose of the assessment. It is normal practice for centres to build up a
bank of assessments which can be used in whole or in part for re-assessment
purposes.
Assessment writers should always refer to the unit specification when developing
an alternative assessment to ensure that it is of equal demand to the original
assessment and that it covers all the necessary criteria. Where candidates have
not provided satisfactory evidence for knowledge and/or skills items which have
been sampled, they should be reassessed on a different sample.
Re-assessing SQA Advanced Graded Units
Re-assessment of the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 should be based on an
alternative examination paper. Re-assessment of Electrical Engineering: Graded
Unit 2 should normally entail a candidate undertaking a completely new project.
Where a candidate marginally fails the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 2 the
centre may wish to reassess her/him on that part(s) of the performance which was
unsatisfactory. Such re-assessment would be at the discretion of the centre and
should be subject to rigorous internal moderation.

Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 36
7 General information for centres
7.1 Equality and inclusion
The unit specifications making up this group award have been designed to ensure
that there are no unnecessary barriers to learning or assessment. The individual
needs of learners will be taken into account when planning learning experiences,
selecting assessment methods or considering alternative evidence.
Further advice can be found on our website
www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.
7.2 Internal and external verification
All instruments of assessment used within these group awards should be internally
verified using the appropriate policy within the centre and the guidelines set by SQA.
External verification will be carried out by SQA to ensure that internal assessment is
within the national guidelines for these qualifications.
Further information on internal and external verification can be found in SQA’s Guide to
Assessment (www.sqa.org.uk).
7.3 Assessment moderation
All assessment instruments used within the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards should be internally moderated,
including assessment exemplar materials, using appropriate policies within the centre
and guidelines provided by SQA. This will ensure the validity and reliability of the
instruments of assessment used within the centre.
External moderation will be carried out by SQA to ensure that internal assessment is
within the national guidelines for these qualifications.
For further information on internal and external moderation refer to the SQA Guide to
Assessment and Quality Assurance for Colleges of Further Education, August 2003
revision.
7.4 Open and Distance Learning
Advice on the use of open and distance learning is given in individual unit
specifications. However, where it is used with regard to assessment, planning would
be required by the centre concerned to ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of
candidate evidence. Arrangement would be required to be put in place to ensure that
the assessment or assessments were conducted under the conditions specified in the
unit specification. For example, in the case of a unit which involved a unit end test a
centre would have to make arrangements for the test to be conducted under
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 37
controlled, supervised conditions. Likewise, where a unit involves a practical based
assessment, a centre would have to make arrangements for candidates to come into
the centre to undertake the assessment under the conditions specified in the unit
specification.
It should be noted that the same requirements as specified in the previous paragraph
apply where part or all of a unit is delivered online.
7.5 General information for candidates
The new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
Engineering awards have been designed by an expert team of educators and
industrialists with a view to allowing you to meet the educational requirements to work
as an electrical incorporated engineer. The two new qualifications contain up-to-date
and relevant electrical subject content and skills and have also been designed to
satisfy the new SQA Higher National Design Principles.
The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team has designed the two new awards
so that you will have opportunities to learn and understand the core principles and
technologies that underpin Electrical Engineering. Learning these will be essential in
providing you with a platform for tackling many electrical tasks and in allowing you to
develop a more in-depth knowledge of Electrical Engineering. At the same time
studying the new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
Engineering awards will provide you with opportunities to develop sound practical
electrical investigation, construction, testing and project skills which are critical to
being a good electrical technician and/or incorporated engineer.
As well as studying Electrical subjects you will also take Communication with an
option to do Information Technology as part of the SQA Advanced Certificate. Good
Communication skills are essential to understanding technical material, and when
communicating with others whether on an individual basis or when working as part of
a team. Information Technology underpins much of the work in Electrical Engineering
whether this is through computer simulation of electrical and electronic circuits or
systems or in preparing a written report on the work you have been involved in.
Opportunities to develop Information Technology knowledge and skills are available in
a number of units in the SQA Advanced Certificate, but an optional unit on Information
Technology Applications is also available if you wish to consolidate your skills in this
area.
The Communication and Information Technology units are mandatory within the SQA
Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award although you will not need to study
these units if you have already done so as part of the SQA Advanced Certificate.
There is an additional mandatory core unit in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
Engineering award entitled Business Awareness and Continuing Professional
Development. This unit will provide you with an awareness of the business pressures
on modern electrical companies and what strategies they are adopting to meet these
pressures. The unit will also provide you with the opportunity to develop your own
career and education action plan for the next five years or so.
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 38
As already mentioned Electrical Engineering is very much about learning and
understanding core principles and technologies while also doing practical work such
as constructing and testing circuits and project work. Thus, while taking the SQA
Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards
you can anticipate that the teaching and learning approaches adopted by your
lecturers will include the following: lecturing, group work, practical electrical and
electronics work, inspection and testing, computer simulation of circuits and
installations and project work.
The Electrical Development Team has ensured that assessments in the two awards
meet national standards. The two awards have been designed to optimise
assessment so that sufficient time is available for you to learn the electrical principles
and technologies and the practical skills that are essential to being a good electrical
technician and incorporated engineer.
You can expect to do assessment at individual unit level and at qualification level. At
unit level, assessment will consist of some form of written end test, or a combination
of short written test and practical exercise or a purely practical exercise. Your lecturer
should tell you at the start of the unit what form the unit assessment will take. In
additional, to unit tests there will also be a 3-hour examination at SQA Advanced
Certificate level and a 2-credit project at SQA Advanced Diploma level. Both these
assessments have been designed to allow you to demonstrate your ability to integrate
knowledge, understanding and skills learned in the two awards as a whole.
The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team does not wish to place any artificial
barriers in the way of potential candidates wanting to study the two awards. However,
it would be unfair to enrol a candidate into the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
Advanced Diploma who did not have a realistic chance of successfully achieving
either or both awards. The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team would
therefore recommend that a candidate had one of the following qualifications before
entering the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
Engineering:
(1) One Higher from Physics, Technological Studies or Higher Mathematics and
at least three Standard Grades 1-2/Intermediate 2 passes including
Mathematics, Physics/Technological Studies and English.
(2) A National Certificate in Electrical Engineering or Electronic Engineering.
(3) Equivalent qualifications or experience to those shown in (1) and (2).
An SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
award no longer satisfies the full academic requirements to become an incorporated
engineer (a degree is now required). However, the new SQA Advanced Certificate
and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards provide a very solid
platform for candidates to proceed to the advanced stages of a degree programme in
Electrical Engineering. Ask your lecturer about progression arrangements your college
has with any universities.

Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 39
7.6 Relationship to other awards
An SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electronics were
validated in 2004. Since a number of units are common between SQA Advanced
Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering and Electronics
awards candidates will have opportunities to transfer a significant number of units
between the various awards. More limited opportunities will exist for candidates to
transfer units between the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in
Electrical Engineering awards and awards in Mechanical Engineering, Manufacturing
Systems, Mechatronics, General Engineering and Fabrication and Welding and vice
versa.
7.7 Articulation arrangements
All the universities in Scotland were contacted regarding possible articulation routes
between the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
Engineering awards and degree courses offered by the universities. In general terms,
universities indicated that they will allow candidates with an SQA Advanced Certificate
to enter the first year of their electrical engineering (or related engineering) degree
programmes. Candidates with an SQA Advanced Diploma will normally be allowed to
enter the second year of a degree programme provided they have the unit,
Mathematics for Engineering 3.
8 Glossary of terms
Embedded Core Skills: The assessment evidence for the unit also includes full
evidence for complete Core Skill or Core Skill components. A learner successfully
completing the unit will be automatically certificated for the Core Skill. (This depends
on the unit having been successfully audited and validated for Core Skills
certification.)
Finish date: The end of a group award’s lapsing period is known as the finish date.
After the finish date, the group award will no longer be live and the following applies:
• Candidates may not be entered for the group award.
• The group award will continue to exist only as an archive record on the Awards
Processing System (APS).
Graded unit: Graded units assess learners’ ability to integrate what they have learned
while working towards the units of the group award. Their purpose is to add value to
the group award, making it more than the sum of its parts, and to encourage learners
to retain and adapt their skills and knowledge. (Note to writer: delete if not applicable
to product type).
Lapsing date: When a group award is entered into its lapsing period, the following will
apply:
• The group award will be deleted from the relevant catalogue.
• The group award specification will remain until the qualification reaches its finish
date, at which point it will be removed from SQA's website and archived.
SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 40
• No new centres may be approved to offer the group award.
• Centres should only enter candidates whom they expect to complete the group
award during the defined lapsing period.
SQA credit value: The credit value allocated to a unit gives an indication of the
contribution the unit makes to an SQA group award. An SQA credit value of 1 given to
an SQA unit represents approximately 40 hours of programmed learning, teaching,
and assessment.
SCQF: The Scottish Credit and Qualification Framework (SCQF) provides the national
common framework for describing all relevant programmes of learning and
qualifications in Scotland. SCQF terminology is used throughout this guide to refer to
credits and levels. For further information on the SCQF, visit the SCQF website at
www.scqf.org.uk.
SCQF credit points: SCQF credit points provide a means of describing and
comparing the amount of learning that is required to complete a qualification at a
given level of the framework. One National Unit credit is equivalent to 6 SCQF credit
points. One National Unit credit at Advanced Higher and one SQA Advanced Unit
credit (irrespective of level) is equivalent to 8 SCQF credit points.
SCQF levels: The level a qualification assigned within the framework is an indication
of how hard it is to achieve. The SCQF covers 12 levels of learning. SQA Advanced
Certificates and SQA Advanced Diplomas are available at SCQF levels 7 and 8,
respectively. SQA Advanced units will normally be at levels 6–9 and graded units will
be at level 7 and 8. National Qualification Group Awards are available at SCQF levels
2–6 and will normally be made up of National Units which are available from SCQF
levels 2–7.
Subject unit: These contain vocational/subject content and are designed to test a
specific set of knowledge and skills.
Signposted Core Skills: These refer to opportunities to develop Core Skills in
learning and teaching, but are not automatically certificated.

9 History of changes
It is anticipated that changes will take place during the life of the qualification, and this section
will record these changes. This document is the latest version and incorporates the changes
summarised below. Centres are advised to check SQA Connect to confirm that they are using
the most up-to-date qualification structure.
NOTE: Where a unit is revised by another unit:
• No new centres may be approved to offer the unit which has been revised.
• Centres should only enter candidates for the unit which has been revised where they
are expected to complete the unit before its finish date.

As with the previous SQA Advanced Certificate grid, it is recognised that timetabling in a four block system is not done by every centre. The above grid
is therefore only a guide indicating the order of delivery of units.
Centres may wish to spread the delivery of units over more than one block which would allow more units to be delivered in parallel.
Whichever delivery arrangement is used, it is important to complete the delivery of ALL the SQA Advanced Diploma units over the two years of a full-
time programme.

SQA Advanced Unit Specification
General information for centres
Unit title: High Level Engineering Software
Unit code: HP41 47
Unit purpose: This Unit is designed to give candidates knowledge and understanding and apply
basic software engineering concepts to solving electrical and electronic engineering problems that
require a software solution. The emphasis in this Unit is on writing and testing and documenting I/O
programs using the basic structures available in most high level languages.
This Unit provides the candidates with the opportunity to develop skills in system design (top-down
design), detailed design (using flow charts or program design language), implementation in the design
in a high level language and verification of the design. This Unit also allows the candidates to develop
their communication skills by generating the documentation for the designed solution.
On completion of the Unit the candidate should be able to:
1 Write, test and document linear programs using I/O statements.
2 Write, test and document I/O programs using conditional statements.
3 Write, test and document I/O programs using iterative loop statements.
4 Write, test and document an I/O program, incorporating subroutines.
Credit value: 1 SQA Credit at SCQF level 7: (8 SCQF credit points at SCQF level 7*)
*SCQF credit points are used to allocate credit to qualifications in the Scottish Credit and Qualifications
Framework (SCQF). Each qualification in the Framework is allocated a number of SCQF credit points at an
SCQF level. There are 12 SCQF levels, ranging from National 1 to Doctorates.
Recommended prior knowledge and skills: Candidates should have a basic knowledge
of electronics, logic operations and number systems. This may be evidenced by possession of a
Higher in Electronics or the following National Qualification Units D134 11 Combinational Logic or
E9LG 11 Computing in Engineering 1 or D980 11 Programmable Systems.
Core Skills: There may be opportunities to gather evidence towards Core Skills in this Unit,
although there is no automatic certification of Core Skills or Core Skills components.
Context for delivery: This Unit was developed for the SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma in
Electronics award. If the Unit is used in another Group Award(s) it is recommended that it should be
taught and assessed within the context of the particular Group Award(s) to which it contributes. The
platform for this Unit may be a micro-controller system or a standard personal computer with access
to I/O ports.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP41 47: High Level Engineering Software 2
Assessment: It is recommended that this Unit be assessed via a logbook or portfolio and
programming projects or assignments that cover the knowledge and skill presented in each Outcome.
Centres should take every reasonable effort to ensure that reports are the candidates’ own work. It
may be possible to issue each candidate with a slightly different specification of equal complexity, or
alternatively where there is a suspicion of copying or plagiarism, an appropriate response may be to
interview candidates. A checklist should be used to record oral evidence of the candidates’
understanding.
Centres are recommended to develop appropriate checklists to support the assessment requirements
for each of the knowledge and skills items. Centres are also recommended to produce a marking
schedule based on the Evidence Requirements listed indicating clearly the required content of the
report. Candidates who do not meet the standard should be obliged to correct and resubmit their work.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification

Unit specification: support notes
Unit title: High Level Engineering Software
This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional design length
is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
This Unit has been written in order to allow candidates to develop the knowledge, understanding and
skills in the area of Software Engineering by writing and testing I/O programs. The following
processes illustrate Software Engineering:
• user requirements
• problem specification
• system design (partitioning into manageable tasks)
• detailed design (design of individual modules)
• implementation (coding into chosen programming language)
• program verification (software testing)
• program maintenance (extending the program for the future)
With validation and documentation taking place at all the stages.
This Unit was designed to permit the candidates to apply the software engineering techniques to
formulate the solutions to engineering tasks involving input and output ports. Software may be
developed for a PC or single board computer or a micro-controller in conjunction with an applications
board. Candidates may be provided with subprograms to configure and read/write input/output ports.
This Unit was developed as one of four SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma in Engineering
Programming options and is at SCQF level 7. This Unit should be completed before tackling the level
8 Unit, High Level Language: External I/O Transfer.
The Unit has identified the topics that are expected to be covered by lecturers. The Unit also gives
recommendations as to how much time should be spent on each Outcome. This has been done to help
lecturers to decide what depth of treatment should be given to the topics attached to each of the
Outcomes. Whilst it is not mandatory for a centre to use this list of topics it is strongly recommended
that they do so to ensure continuity of teaching and learning across the Engineering Computing Units
and because the assessment exemplar pack for this Unit is based on the Knowledge and/or Skills and
list of topics in each of the Outcomes.
A list of topics is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list in conjunction with the
assessment exemplar pack for this Unit so they can get a clear indication of the standard of
achievement expected of candidates taking the Unit.

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This is the first engineering programming Unit on the SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma Electronics
and for many candidates this may be their first encounter with programming. In this respect it may be
advisable to deliver this Unit on a free-standing basis.
Each candidate should have access to a computer loaded with appropriate OS and High Level
Language software. Additionally workstations should be available on which candidates are able to test
I/O based programs.
Delivery of all the Outcomes may be carried out using an LCD projector so that the candidates can
view the actual code of the sample programs and see their execution with prepared test data in real
terms.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP41 47: High Level Engineering Software 10
This introductory Unit should be used to develop the candidate’s confidence in the basic
programming concepts and as such should be taken before considering assembly language
programming.
It is suggested that the Unit assessment take the form of a logbook or portfolio covering the four
Outcomes.
For example, assuming a two-hour class per week, then over a 20-week period the assessment
schedule may be:
Weeks 1 to 5 Linear programming
Outcome 1 assignments completed (2hours)
Weeks 6 to 10 Non-linear programming for I/O ports using selection statements
Outcome 2 assignments completed (2hours)
Weeks 11 to 15 Non-linear I/O programming using iterative loops
Outcome 3 assignments completed (2hours)
Weeks 16 to 20 I/O programming using bit-wise operations
Outcome 4 assignments completed (4hours)
Open learning
This Unit is more suitable for laboratory delivery however it could be delivered by distance learning
provided the candidate has the appropriate hardware. This may require some degree of on-line
support. However, with regard to assessment, planning would be required by the centre concerned to
ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence. Arrangements would be required to be
put in place to ensure that assessment whether done at a single or at multiple events was conducted
under controlled, supervised conditions.
To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that a single assessment paper
(taken by candidates at a single assessment event) be used for distance learning candidates.
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative
evidence.
Further advice can be found on our website www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP41 47: High Level Engineering Software 11
General information for candidates
Unit title: High Level Engineering Software
This is the first of four Engineering Programming Units in the SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma
Electronics. This Unit introduces you to I/O programming in the context of the Software Engineering
Process. This process allows you to break down the overall programming task into manageable sub
tasks.
These smaller modules are then developed, debugged and tested using a High Level Language. The
overall program is then constructed by integrating the modules one by one and testing as the program
builds up. The final program is tested for functionality and each branch is exercised using appropriate
test data.
This Unit teaches you:
• system design (partitioning of a software task)
• detailed design (stepwise refinement using pseudo code or flowcharts)
• coding in a High Level Language
• compiling and debugging
• preparing test data and verifying program function
• documentation
In addition you will learn and practise the following programming constructs:
• linear programming
• IF…THEN, IF…THEN…ELSE, CASE…
• FOR…NEXT…DO
• REPEAT…UNTIL
• WHILE…DO
• procedure/functions
• logical bit-wise operations
You will be presented with a variety of programs, but the emphasis will be on driving or controlling
hardware interface circuitry. Hence you will also cover INPUT/OUTPUT ports, configuring them,
writing to them and reading from them.
The time allocated for this Unit is 40 hours. If you are new to programming then you will probably
require to spend double this amount as the practical activities can be time consuming. It is in your
interest not just to pass the Unit for qualification needs but to master it, as most electronics related
jobs and higher study demand the skills and knowledge embedded in this Unit.
Your assessment for this Unit will be assignments covering each of the four Outcomes, to be carried
out in the context of the Software Engineering Process. Class time allocated for this will be about 14
hours, however you will be expected to devote the same number of hours in private study for the
assignments. The written assignments must conform to the standard set out by the lecturer. Outcome 4
must be submitted within 14 days of completion of the Unit.

Evidence Requirements for this Unit
Learners will need to provide evidence to demonstrate their Knowledge and/or Skills across
all Outcomes by showing that they can:
Outcome 1
• Use five hardware devices, (eg mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor, disk drive, scanner)
• Start up and close down the operating system
• Open and close software packages
• Locate data and applications
• Use a filing system, (eg to organise folders and sub-directories applying naming
conventions)
• Use two tools within the operating system, (eg file managers, print managers and control
panels)
• Implement security measures responsibly and with consideration for the needs of other
users, (eg passwords, backups, virus protection)
• Resolve one hardware and one software problem, (eg printer off-line, sound not working,
too many open programs, system freeze, software option settings, etc)
Outcome 2
• Identify the information requirements of users and how these requirements can be met
• Select software applications packages which are appropriate to meet the identified
information requirements
• Use four or more software applications packages to process the identified information
requirements and which output two or more different data types, (eg text, number,
graphics, audio, video) in the form of documents, designs, compositions, models or
presentations
• Carry out three searches to extract and present relevant information from suitable local
and remote computer data sources. A minimum of two searches must be from remote
computer data sources. To do this the learner will be required to:
— Plan how to find the information and make decisions about searches taking account
of efficiency in terms of time, cost, effective filtering and Outcome
— Extract information, (eg text, number, graphics, audio, video) which matches several
search criteria, (eg keywords, fields, file names, screen grabber, digital camera or
scanner). Searches must be different from each other, eg searching two different
sources, or searching the same source for two different forms of information
• Integrate two or more different data types, (eg text, number, graphics, audio, video) from
more than two software applications packages into a single product. The product may be
in the form of a document, design, composition, model or presentation

Unit Support Notes are offered as guidance and are not mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
design length is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
This unit provides a solid basis on which further IT skills can be built. It will enable learners to
use IT systems with minimal support, paying due regard to security. Electronic data sources
are to be used, learners are expected to achieve effective results when using IT software in
an unfamiliar context by using on-line help facilities and suppliers’ handbooks. Basic
configuration and fault-finding skills are to be taught. Files should be provided for learners as
appropriate to negate the need for them to enter large amounts of text or data.
This unit is very much aimed at enabling learners to obtain and use data and software
applications packages associated with the internet and email, ie electronic communications.
Therefore, there should be considerable emphasis placed upon providing access to
appropriate data and software associated with electronic communications. Candidates
should then be encouraged to learn for themselves the benefits of being able to integrate
information from diverse sources and produce documents, designs, compositions, models or
presentations of a complex nature.
The unit can be approached from the standpoint of using information technology to support a
range of information processing activities. The learner should be able to plan for, develop
and produce the relevant information requirements of users.
Candidates should achieve the level of competence required of a regular user of IT
applications software in a commercial or professional situation. Candidates will require
individual access to a personal computer/workstation. It is suggested that, wherever
possible, commercially available current versions of industry standard software be used. The
component parts of an integrated software package along with its operating environment can
be used to achieve all Outcomes. This should not be prohibitive in the case of the centres,
but may be an issue if being undertaken in the workplace.
It is generally assumed that the environment for this unit will be, for example, Microsoft
Windows and Office 97/2000 or Lotus, or other vendor equivalents, however, this is not
specified and the Outcome requirements are deliberately generic in nature.
Outcome 1 looks at the components of hardware, the functions of operating system tools and
how these are used. Data security measures, resolving common hardware and software
problems are also pre-eminent. All of the elements should be taught in the context of giving
attention to the needs of other users of a computer system.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HP6L 47, Information Technology: Applications Software 1 (SCQF level 7) 6
Outcome 2 looks at using a range of software packages to meet complex information
requirements. Centres can choose four or more packages (a minimum of four different
packages must be used) from the whole range of applications packages available. The
software application packages chosen must be relevant to the vocational area of the Group
Award undertaken by the learner. The emphasis in this Outcome should be on producing
complex information in a context that is unfamiliar to the learner. Candidates should be able
to integrate data types, (eg text, number, graphics, audio, video) into a single product and to
format the product so that the final output is clear and helpful to users. Candidates should
show that they can plan for the information requirements; select and use software packages
appropriate to information requirements; select suitable computer data sources for
information and extract suitable information from these computer data sources to meet
relevant requirements.
An indication of the range of activities that learners are expected to be able to carry out when
using a variety of software applications packages during the course of this unit is given below
for some of the ‘standard’ applications that centres may use. This should not be taken to be a
‘prescriptive’, or indeed, an exhaustive list of requirements but should help to serve as a
guide to the level of skills required.
1 Selection and use of appropriate software applications packages and electronic data
sources from both local and remote computers.
2 Selection and use of document layout, page layout and format facilities, eg: views, use
of toolbars, rulers, guides, zoom, fonts, bullets and numbering, borders and shading,
tabs, case, dropped capitals, columns, themes, backgrounds, styles, frames, colours
and lines, alignment, templates, auto-format.
3 Use of on-line help and tutorial support facilities.
4 File Handling, eg properties, naming conventions, saving, saving for use with web and
other applications, retrieving, retrieving from web and other applications, copying,
renaming, importing, exporting, emailing, attachments, routing, and faxing.
5 Editing, eg undo, repeat, cut, copy, paste, paste special, select all, fill, clear, find,
replace, go to, rename, links, and objects.
6 Selection and use of insertions, eg headers and footers, page breaks, comments,
footnotes, captions, numbering, symbols, date and time, index and tables, bookmarks,
pictures, objects, hyperlinks, graphics, movies, sounds, tables, queries, forms and
reports, functions, charts, comments, fields, records and files.
7 Use of ‘tools’, eg spelling and grammar checker; thesaurus; search and replace; auto-
correction; sort; merge; customisation; options; security; protection; macros (simple); on-
line facilities; send and receive; address books, synchronisation, message rules,
messenger services, newsgroups and accounts.
8 Printing, eg printer selection; printer properties; printer set up, eg paper size, paper type,
scaling, orientation, etc; print preview; use of print preview facilities, eg zoom, multiple
pages, ruler, scaling, etc.
9 Searching should involve several criteria, eg key terms or fields, and requires decisions
to be made about an effective strategy for their application, eg with due regard for time,
cost, effective filtering and result.
10 Extracting and presenting relevant information - relevant data may be records in a
database, a photographic image, a video or audio clip. Selection/importation may involve
tools such as screen grabbers, digital or video cameras and scanners.
This unit is designed to enable students to use IT systems and applications independently to
support a range of information processing activities. The unit is designed to develop a
knowledge of the theoretical concepts, principles, boundaries and scope of IT applications.
These activities will be centred on using several software application packages to meet
complex information requirements.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HP6L 47, Information Technology: Applications Software 1 (SCQF level 7) 7
Instrument of assessment
There are two Outcomes, both largely of a practical nature.
Outcome 1: Prove Knowledge and/or Skills of: the different components of a computer
system, the function of tools such as file manager, print manager and control panel, the ways
in which data can be kept secure and the causes of common software and hardware
problems and how to resolve them.
Outcome 2: Uses a range of software application packages, (at least four) to meet complex
information requirements. The learners will be given a comprehensive checklist of all
evidence required to successfully complete this Outcome. They will then have to create a
technical manual and player guide indicating on the checklist exactly where each
requirement has been met. Given the complexity of the technical manuals and user guides
shipped with today’s games, this should make for a demanding, but hopefully enjoyable
experience.
Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
This unit is designed to enable learners to use IT systems independently to support a range
of information processing activities. Early inclusion of this unit in the Group Award is
preferable as students should then be able to present work for other Units using the skills
learned in this unit.
During the course of the unit learners should have several opportunities to develop their
practical skills and should then be assessed appropriately.
Assessment should be by one project or case study. Candidates should have access to on-
line help, tutorial support and/or suppliers’ manuals as required.
Individual centres will need to plan Outcome 2 to ensure that such resources as the internet
service provider, compact discs, available telephone lines, modems, software application
packages and operating systems updates are available prior to commencement of the unit.
If this unit is being delivered as part of a Professional Development Award which receives
endorsement from a vendor such as Microsoft, it must be delivered and evidence generated
as detailed in the document ‘Approval to certification’ which is associated with that particular
vendor and the Professional Development Award.
Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment. The following are
suggestions only. There may be other methods that would be more suitable to learners.
Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
work or further and higher education.
Outcome 2
The emphasis in this Outcome should be on producing complex information in a context
which is unfamiliar to the learner. Centres may wish to complete an observation checklist to
keep track of the learner’s development in the use of the four chosen software applications
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HP6L 47, Information Technology: Applications Software 1 (SCQF level 7) 8
packages. The software application packages chosen must be relevant to the vocational
area of the Group Award undertaken by the learner.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this unit. By e-assessment we
mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
This unit gives automatic certification of the core skill: Using Information Technology at
SCQF level 6.

In Outcome 1 you will learn about the components of hardware, the functions of operating
system tools and how these are used. You will also learn about data security measures and
resolving common hardware and software problems. You will learn about all of the elements
above in the context of meeting the needs of all users of a computer system.
In Outcome 2 you will learn about how to use a range of software packages to meet complex
information requirements. You will learn about a minimum of four different software packages
from the whole range of applications packages available. The emphasis in this Outcome will
be on producing complex information in a context that is unfamiliar to you. You will learn how
to integrate data types, (eg text, number, graphics, audio, video) into a single product and to
format the product so that the final output is clear and helpful to users. You will find out how
to: plan to meet users’ information requirements; select software packages appropriate to
information requirements; select suitable computer data sources for information and extract
suitable information from these computer data sources to meet relevant user requirements.
To complete this unit successfully, you must demonstrate a satisfactory level of performance
in a number of tasks covering the Outcomes listed above. You must provide evidence of the
work you carry out for each assessment task in the form of a set of printed documents with a
front cover: each print having details of your name, the date and the task. You will be
encouraged to access on-line help facilities, tutorial support and/or suppliers’ manuals as
required.
More detailed guidance on the content, amount, style and quality required of your work will
be made available to you during your progress through the unit. Your assessor will observe

during its normal life-cycle.
2. Recommended tests to verify the integrity of an electrical installation.
3. Requirements and precautions for testing electrical installations
4. Testing procedures which conform to British Standard requirements
In designing this Unit, the unit writer has identified the range of topics expected to be covered by
lecturers. The writer has also given recommendations as to how much time should be spent on each
Outcome. This has been done to help lecturers decide what depth of treatment should be given to the
topics attached to each of the Outcomes. Whilst it is not mandatory for centres to use this list of
topics, it is recommended that they do so since the assessment exemplar pack for this Unit is based on
the knowledge and/or skills and list of topics in each of the Outcomes.
A list of topics for each Outcome is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list in
conjunction with the assessment exemplar pack so that they can get a clear indication of the standard
of achievement expected of candidates in this Unit
1 Explain the general requirements for the inspection and testing of an electrical
installation during its normal life-cycle. (10 hrs)
This Outcome should provide candidate with an understanding of the general requirements for
inspection and testing of an electrical installation when it is newly installed, the periodicity of re-
inspecting and testing and the action that should be taken if alterations or additions are made. The
requirements of part seven of BS7671 provided the technical foundation for developing the subject
and the IEE guidance notes on Inspection and Testing (ISBN 0-85296-991-0) develop the regulations.
• Safety
• Required competence
• The Client
• Record keeping
• Purpose of initial verification
• Frequency of subsequent installations

out; the requirements that have to be met to satisfy part seven of BS7671 and the methods of tests that
are to be performed.
The Outcome should provide candidates with an understanding of why it is necessary to know the
value of the prospective short circuit current and the external earth loop impedance and also provide
an explanation of how to approach the measurement of these.
• Purpose of periodic inspection and testing
• Necessity for periodic inspection and testing
• Initial testing
Electrical installation: TN-S; TN-C-S; T.T. Systems
Tests: Continuity of protective conductors main and supplementary bonding, continuity of ring final
circuit conductors; insulation resistance; polarity tests; earth electrode resistance; earth fault loop
impedance; operation of residual current devices; measurement of characteristics of supply at the
origin of the circuit.
3 Explain the requirements and precautions for testing electrical installations (10 hrs)
This Outcome should provide the candidate with an understanding of why safety documentation is
essential before work is carried out in organisations that specify permits-to-work and sanction-to-test
documents as part of their safety policy. The responsibility of the electrical contractor to comply
with safety procedures and the delegation of authorised signatories by the company to the contractor,
for safety documents, should be discussed. The need to recognise that intrinsically safe instruments
are required in installations designated as hazardous should be emphasised. Reference only is
required to the zoning of areas and the types of environment where more specialist testing
consideration is necessary.
Relevant requirements of the Health and Safety at Work Act and the Electricity at Work Regulations
in an industrial environment, where additional hazards may be present, permits-to-work and
sanctions-for-test.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification

Requirements: instrument accuracy; field and instrument errors; routine calibration and checking of
low resistance ohmmeter; insulation resistance ohmmeter; applied voltage tester; earth fault loop
impedance testers; earth electrode, test sets; RCD Testers.
4 Carry out appropriate testing procedures which conform to British Standard
requirements (10 hrs)
This Outcome should provide the candidate with the opportunity to prepare for inspection and testing
and carry out inspection and testing.
The centre will require a simulated test rig(s) to enable the tests specified in the range statement to be
carried out effectively. It is recommended that the rig(s) should be supplied from a three-phase
isolator and feed a single-phase distribution board from which lighting circuits and power circuits are
supplied. A three phase motor circuit should be provided for. A residual current device or devices
should be included in the design. The design of the rig or rigs is not critical providing all the tests
can be performed effectively. Different rigs can be used to cover the complete range of tests.
Observation checklists are required for each of the tests. The candidate should be given the
necessary work instructions to carry out the testing. A selection of the necessary hand tools and a
range of test instruments should be provided. During the test the candidate will be expected to record
all relevant information and tests results for all circuits on an appropriate results sheets; safe working
practice must be observed throughout the inspection and testing procedure.
Technical data: available diagrams; charts; previous test results for inspection; test
certificates; general characteristics of installation; access to design data (new installation).
Isolation procedure: isolate; lock off; issue permit-to-work; complete permit documentation; test for
dead.
Test of external earth loop impedance and prospective short circuit current (PSCC); protective
conductors continuity: continuity of ring final circuit conductors; insulation resistance; polarity;
Earth fault loop impedance; earth electrode resistance; operation of residual current devices
A candidate-centred learning approach is recommended. Underpinning theory should be reinforced
by use of short testing exercises where a hands-on-approach should be encouraged. Throughout the
Unit the importance of accurate documentation should be stressed. Safety procedures and practices
should be observed at every stage of the unit.

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit has been designed to incorporate sufficient time to allow lecturers/assessors to
present all of the electrical design procedure content contained in the Unit. There is also
sufficient time for candidates to take appropriate measurements and undertake appropriate
analysis on electrical installations to consolidate their learning.
It is strongly recommended that candidates are encouraged to examine the various
equipment, earthing and network system components within their learning environment.
Design charts, graphs, tables and touch voltage curves should be integrated within the
learning and where possible actual measured values should be used to strengthen
knowledge and understanding of design and safety requirements. It is essential candidates
are able to relate theory to practice of functional design procedures. During the delivery of
the Unit, lecturers should be selective in the data and manufacturers reference material that
is necessary for candidates to satisfactorily complete the relevant Outcome. Lecturers
should use their teaching and formative assessment strategies to encourage candidates to
clearly link the design requirements for functional requirements and essential safety factors
to reducing the risk of electric shock and temperature rise which could result in a fire. This
approach should help to develop candidates’ critical thinking skills.
With the expansion of data cable networks an overview of the requirements of the hardware
and procedures required to fault find should be clearly outlined and consolidated with
reference to the Internet and other relevant technical support systems.
Candidates will have opportunities to develop their Written Communication skills principally
through the preparation of the written report for Outcome 3. Candidates will also have an
opportunity to develop their Use of Numbers skills through the various cable calculations
they will undertake as part of the Unit. They may also have opportunities to develop their
Using Graphical Information skills by interpreting and using various forms of circuit and
wiring diagrams and communication network representations throughout the Unit.
Information on Evidence Requirements and assessment guidelines is given after Outcomes
2 and 3 in the higher national Unit specification, statement of standards section. The written
assessment should take place after Outcomes 1 and 2 have been completed. Outcome 3
can be delivered independently and the assignment presented to the candidates for
completion throughout the remaining time allocated to the Unit.
Open learning
This Unit can be delivered by open learning which may incorporate some degree of online
support. However with regards to assessment, planning will be required by the centre to
ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence.
Arrangements will be required to be put in place for the combined written assessment paper
for Outcomes 1 and 2 to ensure it is conducted under controlled and supervised conditions.
To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended for distance learning
candidates that the date for the assessment paper date is organised well in advance.
HV2W 47, Electrical Design Systems: An Introduction (SCQF level 7) 10

SQA Advanced Unit Specification: support notes
Unit title: Electrical Installation Design (Computer Aided): An Introduction
This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional design length
is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
This Unit has been written in order to allow candidates to develop knowledge, understanding and
skills in using computer software in the following areas:
1 Developing electrical schematic diagrams.
2 Performing electrical design calculations.
3 Producing electrical installation design reports.
In designing this Unit, the Unit writer has identified the range of topics that he would expect to be
covered by lecturers. It is recommended that lecturers spend 20 hours covering these topics before
candidates start the two assignments. Whilst it is not mandatory for centres to use this list of topics, it
is recommended that they do so.
A list of topics for each Outcome is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list so that they
can get a clear indication of the standard of achievement expected of candidates in this Unit.
1 Develop electrical schematic diagrams
• extract the logic of the electrical installations to be designed
• translate this ‘logic’ into an acceptable electrical schematic diagram
• incorporate acceptable symbols within the electrical schematic diagram
• drafting (the drawing should be incorporated in a suitable template giving, as a
minimum, the candidate’s name, class, Unit number, college session and drawing
number)
• labelling
2 Perform electrical installation design calculations using computer software
From the scale of appropriate drawings (adding a suitable correction amount, 10% suggested)
estimate cable lengths and enter this data:
• correctly select and enter the load types
• correctly select distribution boards in terms of number of ways and number of phases
• correctly select the cable types, their methods of installation and any further correction
factors applicable and correctly connect these to their termination points
• correctly select the required protective devices
• carry out the design calculation
• identify, investigate and rectify faults to give an acceptable installation design
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit (HV2X 47): Electrical Installation Design (Computer Aided): An Introduction 9
3 Produce electrical installation design reports
Reports must be identified by, as a minimum, the candidate name and assignment identifier.
Produce an appropriate input and design parameter reports to include:
• cable schedules
• circuit design data
• fault report
All to an acceptable standard.
Practically based assignments: 20 hours.
Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit should be presented at all times with reference to the specific design software available.
The software employed is at the discretion of the centre but it must be specifically an electrical
installation design package.
It is recommended that the candidates undertake the assignments after an initial 20-hour introduction
to the software package in conjunction with the use of design tutorials.
In delivering this Unit candidates should be provided with the opportunity to gain as much ‘hands on’
experience as possible. Ideally each candidate should have a p.c. to work with but if, due to resource
constraints, this is not possible, then, for non-assessment purposes candidates should work in small
groups. If candidates work in small groups it is essential that each candidate makes a full contrition to
electrical installation software developments. Candidates must undertake the assignments on an
individual basis.
Candidates will have opportunities to develop their Using Information Technology core skills while
using the electrical installation design software to input data, perform calculations and output reports.
Opportunities to develop critical thinking skills may take place while developing electrical installation
designs.
Details on approaches to assessment are given under the Assessment guidelines in Outcome 3 in the
SQA Advanced Unit specification: statement of standards section. It is recommended that this section
be read carefully before proceeding with assessment of candidates.
Opportunities for developing Core Skills
There are opportunities to develop the Core Skills of Using Graphical Information and Critical
Thinking at SCQF level 6 in this Unit, although there is no automatic certification of Core Skills or
Core Skills components.

Open learning
Candidates who have access to suitable software (for example in their employment) could take this
Unit by open and distance learning which may include on-line support. With regard to assessment
however, planning would be required by the centre concerned to ensure the authenticity of candidate
evidence. Arrangements would require to be put in place to ensure that assessment was conducted
under controlled and supervised conditions.
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to learning
or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when planning learning
experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative evidence.

supervised conditions. You will be allowed access to a copy of the current wiring regulations. BS
7671 and an equipment manufacturer’s catalogue.
The first assignment will comprise input data for a complete installation. The candidate will then be
required to translate this into a schematic diagram and input the data of the software design. You will
then produce a satisfactory personalised report for your electrical installation design which will be
acceptable within the electrical design/contracting industry.
The second assignment will comprise a design description including a given scale drawing of a
building, showing:
• the location of all relevant accessories and loads
• cable routing
• containment methods
• types of cabling
• the arrangements of the live conductors
• type of earthing and
• the characteristics of the supply
The candidate will then be required to translate this into a schematic diagram and the input data of a
software design. You will then produce a satisfactory personalised report for your electrical
installation design which will be acceptable within the electrical design/contracting industry.
This assignment will normally be carried out at the end of the delivery of the Unit.

General information for candidates
Unit title: Electrical Safety
This Unit has been designed to allow you to develop an appreciation of electrical safety and
to further your knowledge and understanding of the requirements and features of permit-to-
work systems in relation to electrical systems.
The Unit will provide you with an appreciation of the need for assessing the risks associated
with working with electrical systems and equipment and the importance of ensuring that
such systems are properly isolated from the supply prior to any work being carried out. It
introduces the concept of an ‘operational plan’ for safe working on electrical systems and
develops the features of such a plan.
It is important that, before you carry out any work on an electrical system, you understand
the features of such a system and how its component parts work together. The Unit
develops this theme in Outcome 2 which describes the features of such a distribution system
and the features of a safe isolation procedure on any relevant section of the network.
Outcome 3 allows you to develop your understanding of permit-to-work systems and
highlights the responsibilities and duties of responsible personnel under such systems. You
will have the opportunity to complete permit-to-work documents.
On completion of this Unit you should have a good appreciation of the need for and
requirements of electrical safety schemes and will be able to implement a generic permit-to-
work system.
The formal assessment of this Unit is in two parts. Firstly, you will be expected to undertake
a closed, book written assessment on your appreciation of the features of operational plans
and electrical distribution systems. Secondly, you will be required to complete an
assignment which involves carrying out a case study for situation which requires a permit-to-
work system of work.

- to develop the Core Skills required by their SQA Advanced programme in an
integrated manner OR
- to prepare for progression to employment OR
- to prepare for progression to a degree or professional qualification OR
- to develop other skills in preparation for the next stage of their careers
The unit focuses on the process of personal development planning – investigate, plan,
implement and evaluate. Candidates will require regular, but non-directive, support to
develop and demonstrate their ability to understand and apply this process. Support can be
provided through a wide range of group and individual tutorial activities and guidance. The
primary purpose is to encourage autonomy and self-directed learning and development. In
this context this is demonstrated where the candidate is able to take responsibility for his/her
own personal, educational and career development. The nature of the unit requires that it be
delivered over an extended period of time. This will normally be one academic session for
full time students or two academic sessions for part time students.
The Assessment Support Pack (ASP) for this unit provides assessment and marking
guidelines that exemplify the national standard for achievement. It is a valid, reliable and
practicable assessment. Centres wishing to develop their own assessments should refer to the
ASP to ensure a comparable standard. A list of existing ASPs is available to download from
SQA’s website (https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/90557.10883.html)
Assessment: The unit should be assessed holistically. To achieve this a candidate should
create, maintain and present a portfolio of evidence - a personal development portfolio. The
activities associated with the unit should provide ample opportunities for candidates to
generate and gather the required evidence of achievement.

length is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
Personal Development Planning is now widely used a wide range of occupations, in higher
education and in the professions, as a mechanism to encourage and support individuals to
take responsibility for their own learning and continuing development. It is described as 'a
structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own
learning, performance and/or achievement and to plan for their personal, educational and
career development' (Universities UK 20022)This unit has been designed to help candidates
undertaking SQA Advanced programmes to benefit from opportunities to participate in
personal development planning, particularly with regard to one or more of the following
contexts:
• integrated Core Skill development OR
• progression to employment OR
• progression from college to university OR
• continuous professional development
The development of autonomy and self-directed learning are the primary considerations in
this unit and personal 'ownership', by the candidate, of the processes of planning,
implementation and evaluation is imperative. Helping candidates to relate the unit activities
to their own personal, educational and career aspirations is an important factor.
To achieve the outcomes for this unit a candidate must demonstrate, through the evidence
gathered and presented in his/her personal development portfolio, the ability to:
• review his/her experience - in terms of personal and formal learning and development
and gather, and present in a portfolio, evidence of achievements, interests and
preferences in a range of contexts, such as formal learning, personal, social, sporting,
leisure activities
• analyse, on the basis of the above, his/her achievements, abilities, and interests; and
identify personal, educational and career aims
• produce a personal action plan, including a set of clear, measurable and achievable
targets - relating to his/her study programme and personal learning/development
• implement the personal action plan
• review and evaluate the personal action plan and its implementation
• gather, present and summarise evidence of the above in his/her personal development
portfolio

SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit (HP6M 47): Personal Development Planning 9
Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
Candidates should create and maintain a personal development portfolio of information and
evidence throughout the unit. They will also be required to devise and implement a personal
action plan, which should include an appropriate set of clear, measurable and achievable
targets.
i Create and Maintain a Personal Development Portfolio
The evidence presented for assessment by each candidate should show that s/he has, acquired
an understanding of the principles underpinning personal development planning; developed
the skills/knowledge necessary to undertake a systematic review and analysis of their
previous experience, achievements, learning, interests and preferences; together with their
development needs. It should demonstrate that he/she has seriously considered personal,
educational and career aims and opportunities; has used this analysis to devise a personal
development plan; and, to develop an action plan, based on clear, measurable and achievable
targets.
Candidates should be given opportunities to examine a range of instruments/frameworks for
personal review and analysis, (such as SWOT, Forcefield and Learning Styles analyses)
together with guidance and support in their use. However, the evidence presented by each
candidate should show that he/she has been able to select and use the instruments which are
most appropriate to his/her particular circumstances.
The evidence should demonstrate that the candidate has been able to review what s/he has
done in the past and what s/he would like to do in the future. Gathering, analysing,
summarising and presenting, in a portfolio, evidence of this is a key feature of the personal
development planning process, as well as being an assessment requirement for this unit.
The evidence presented should include:
• a personal account by the candidate of his/her review of previous experience -
identifying achievements, interests and preferences - and a consideration of what s/he
would like to achieve in personal, educational and career terms. This should include
identifying:
- achievements and existing attributes in terms of personal, social, sporting,
leisure/cultural and educational contexts
- interests and preferences, including learning/development styles
- career/personal aims, together with implications for educational and other
developmental requirements
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit (HP6M 47): Personal Development Planning 10
• a description of his/her personal action plan, showing that it stems from the above
review/analysis, and that it will lead to the achievement of the identified aims. It
should also demonstrate that the candidate has been able to translate his/her aims into
clear, measurable and achievable targets as a part of a personal action plan over a
period of one/two academic sessions. This will require evidence of:
- identifying/considering 'helping' and 'hindering influences' on achievement
of aims
- identifying appropriate short term targets and action points
- considering priorities and planning how to use time effectively, including
the use of deadlines and reviewing progress
- identifying help/support required and where/how it can be accessed
- producing an action plan
▪ a summary, in the portfolio/personal development plan, of the outcomes from the
review, of the analysis and planning stages of the above process.
ii Implementing an action plan
The evidence presented must show that in implementing the personal action plan the
candidate has been able to:
• use the personal action plan to address his/her targets - including planning ahead,
organising time, opportunities and reviewing progress
• select and use different ways of working towards targets, including at least one formal
learning and one informal/practical learning situation
• review/amend the action points as appropriate/necessary - including the ability to
respond to changing circumstances and unexpected difficulties
• seek and use advice from tutors and others - including feedback on performance,
advice on problem-solving and planning future action
• gather, analyse, summarise and present evidence of the above in his/her personal
development portfolio
Although course and guidance tutors play a significant facilitating role, the evidence
presented must demonstrate that the candidate has taken responsibility for his/her own
personal action plan and for learning from the experience of implementing the plan.
The evidence should include a personal account by the candidate describing his/her
implementation of the personal action plan. This should demonstrate the candidates
understanding of the requirement to plan ahead; to organise to use time and opportunities
effectively; and, to review progress. The account should also describe the use of a formal
learning situation - perhaps linked to an SQA Advanced unit - and an informal/experiential
learning situation - perhaps linked to an out of college context, such as personal, social,
leisure/cultural/sporting activities. Evidence should be provided to show that the candidate
was able to amend the plan to accommodate changing or unexpected circumstances and to
show that he/she was able to seek feedback/advice from tutors and other people. This
personal account should be retained in the portfolio.
The candidate should also provide a brief review/analysis of the implementation process.
This should highlight the achievements, learning and development which he/she believes to
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit (HP6M 47): Personal Development Planning 11
have arisen from the implementation process and identify the likely impact on his/her overall
personal development plan.
iii Monitor and Evaluate the personal action plan and its Implementation
The evidence that a candidate gathers and presents should show that s/he has been able to
• review/monitor - on an on-going and summative basis - experience of devising and
implementing their personal action plan; and where/how the plan was modified
• identify, describe and give evidence for personal achievements, learning and
development - including evidence of amending the plan to accommodate
unexpected/changed circumstances
• identify what was learned and how/where learning occurred ie what was learned -
knowledge, skills, attitudes; what learning styles were preferred; where did learning
occur most effectively? what are the implications for future learning?
• identify ways to further improve learning and performance and amend his/her
personal action plan accordingly
Again, the objective of promoting self-directed learning is fundamental to the requirement
that the candidate monitors and evaluates his/her own experience of devising and
implementing an action plan. Under all circumstances candidates must be encouraged to
reflect on their own experience and challenged to use their personal reflection to generate
insights and understanding of their own strengths and development needs. Specifically,
candidates should be helped to identify achievements, learning and developments which have
arisen from their experience and reflection; and, they should be helped to identify ways in
which they might improve further their learning and performance.
Assessment
(Detailed briefing notes and guidance on the creation, maintenance and assessment of
portfolios will be provided for tutors and students.)
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative
evidence.
Further advice can be found on our website www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.

Guidance on the delivery of this Unit
This Unit has been designed to incorporate sufficient time to allow lecturers to teach all of
the electrical motor and transformer subjects contained in the Unit. There is also sufficient
time for candidates to practice what they have learnt through appropriate formative
assessment exercises and practical laboratory work. In regard to practical work, it is
recommended that candidates are allowed to see different types of motors and transformers
disassembled so that they can study the various component parts of motors and
transformers at close hand. Good charts showing the disassembled parts of motors and
transformers will also assist candidate learning. Centres are strongly recommended to allow
candidates to perform a range of practical test on different motors and transformers to
determine essential performance characteristics. This will help candidates to relate theory to
practice.

HT83 47, Electrical Machine Principles (SCQF level 7) 10
Guidance on the assessment of this Unit
It is left to the discretion of centres to decide the order in which the Outcomes are to be
delivered. Regardless of the order chosen centres must ensure that candidates are
assessed by two examination papers and one assignment exercise. Outcomes 1 to 4 should
be assessed by means of the examinations, and Outcomes 5 and 6 should be assessed by
the assignment task.
The assessment for this 2-credit Unit should consist of two closed-book written
examinations, and a written assignment.
Outcomes 1 to 4 should be assessed by the examinations. Both of these written
examinations should have durations of 1.5 hours and should be separate assessment
events. Each examination should assess two of the Outcomes. Both examinations should
be composed of a mixture of structured and short answer questions. These assessments
should be conducted under closed-book, controlled and supervised conditions.
Outcomes 5 and 6 should be assessed by means of an assignment in which the candidate
is required to provide responses to specific questions. This assignment may be completed
outwith the classroom, and candidates will require access to relevant notes, text books,
online resources, etc.
Assessment guidelines
Outcomes 1, 2, 3 and 4
The assessment or Outcomes 1 to 4 should be carried out by two written assessment
papers. Both of these papers should take the form of examinations. Each should have a
duration of 1.5 hours and should be a separate assessment event. Each examination should
assess two of the Outcomes. It is left to the discretion of the centre to decide which two
Outcomes to combine in each paper. Both examinations should be composed of a mixture
of structured and short answer questions. These assessments should be conducted under
closed-book, controlled and supervised conditions, and candidates should not be allowed to
bring any textbooks, handouts or notes to the assessment. Candidates will be permitted to
use scientific calculators.
Outcomes 5 and 6
Outcomes 5 and 6 should be assessed by means of an assignment in which the candidate
is required to provide satisfactory responses to specific questions. This assignment may be
completed outwith the classroom, and candidates will require access to relevant notes, text
books, online resources, etc.
Online and distance learning
This Unit could be delivered by distance learning, which may incorporate some degree of
online support. However, with regards to assessment, planning would be required by the
centre concerned to ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence.
Arrangements would be required to be put in place to ensure that examinations were
conducted under controlled, supervised conditions. With regards to the assessment task for
Outcomes 5 and 6, centres would be required to take steps to check that the assignment
was the candidate’s own work.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HT83 47, Electrical Machine Principles (SCQF level 7) 11
To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that for distance
learning candidates two assessment papers are taken at two separate assessment events
following the guidance given in the SQA Advanced Unit specification: statement of
standards section.

The nature of the project activity detailed in this specification is such that it is likely that centres
will wish their candidates to embark on it from the start of the second year of the SQA
Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering programme. As it is anticipated that centres will
deliver the SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering as part of the first year of the
SQA Advanced Diploma, it is recommended that candidates have completed all SQA Advanced
Certificate in Electrical Engineering Units before commencing this project.
SQA Advanced Graded Unit Specification
J1RC 48: Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit (SCQF level 8) 3
In principle, the project can draw on any Units in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
Engineering Framework although the majority of any units should be at SCQF level 8. The
project can be taken from one Electrical Engineering area (eg Machines) or it can span more
than one technical area. However, its principal purpose is not to integrate technical content (this
is covered in Electrical Engineering: Group Award Graded Unit 1) but rather to combine such
knowledge and skills as planning, construction, testing, evaluating and reporting.
Core Skills
This unit contains automatic certification of the Problem Solving Core Skill at Higher level.
Assessment
This graded unit will be assessed by the use of the practical assignment (electrical engineering
project). The “fleshed-out” practical assignment should provide the candidate with the
opportunity to produce evidence that demonstrates she/he has met the aims of the graded unit
that it covers.
An assessment exemplar pack has been produced to provide centres and candidates with clear
guidance as to the national standard of achievement required at SCQF level 8.
In developing this specification it was decided that candidates must do clearly identifiable
individual projects. However, this does not preclude individual projects being part of a larger
group project. Candidates’ contribution to a larger group project has the advantage of creating
opportunities for the development of the core skill, Working with Others.
Equality and inclusion
This graded unit has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods, or considering alternative
evidence.

Designing the project and assessing learners
Graded unit title: Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 2
Assessment
This graded unit will be assessed by the use of a project-based case practical assignment
developed by centres. The project should provide the learner with the opportunity to produce
evidence that demonstrates that he/she has met the aims of this graded unit.
The project undertaken by the learner must be a complex task which involves:
• variables that are complex or unfamiliar
• relationships which need to be clarified
• a context which may be unfamiliar to the learner
The project must require the learner to:
• analyse the task and decide on a course of action for undertaking the project
• plan and organise work and carry it through to completion
• reflect on what has been done and draw conclusions for the future
• produce evidence of meeting the aims which this graded unit has been designed to cover
Conditions of assessment
The learner should be given a date for completing the project. However, the instructions for the
project should be distributed to allow the learner sufficient time to assimilate the details and
carry out the project. During the time between the distribution of the project instructions and the
completion date, assessors may answer questions, provide clarification, guidance, and
reasonable assistance. The project should be marked as soon as possible after the completion
date.
Reasonable assistance is the term used by SQA to describe the difference between providing
learners with some direction to generate the required evidence for assessment, and providing
too much support which would compromise the integrity of the assessment. Reasonable
assistance is part of all learning and teaching processes. In relation to the assessment of
project-based graded units, assessors may provide advice, clarification, and guidance during
the time between the distribution of the project instructions and the completion date, ie at each
stage of the project.
At this level, candidates should work independently. It is up to centres to take reasonable steps
to ensure that the project is the work of the candidate. For example, centres may wish to
informally question candidates at various stages on their knowledge and understanding of the
project on which they have embarked. Centres should ensure that where research etc, is carried
out in other establishments or under the supervision of others that the candidate does not receive
undue assistance.
SQA Advanced Graded Unit Specification
J1RC 48: Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit (SCQF level 8) 5
Remediation allows an assessor to clarify learner responses, either by requiring a written
amendment or by oral questioning, where there is a minor shortfall or omission in evidence
requirements. In either case, such instances must be formally noted by the assessor, either in
writing or recording, and be made available to the internal and external verifier. In relation to
project-based graded units, learners must be given the opportunity for remediation at each
stage of the project.
The evidence for a project-based graded unit is generated over time and involves three distinct
stages, each of which has to be achieved before the next is undertaken. This means that any
re-assessment of stages must be undertaken before proceeding to the next stage. The overall
grade is derived from the total number of marks across all sections, and should reflect the
ability of the learner to work autonomously and the amount of support required. In relation to
project-based graded units, learners who have failed any stage of the project and have been
unable to provide the necessary evidence through remediation must be given the opportunity
for re-assessment of that stage.
Any learner who has failed their graded unit or wishes to upgrade their award must be given a
re-assessment opportunity, or in exceptional circumstances, two re-assessment opportunities.
In the case of project-based graded units, this must be done using a substantially different
project.
The final grading given must reflect the quality of the learner’s evidence at the time of the
completion of the graded unit. Learners must be awarded the highest grade achieved —
whether through first submission or through any re-assessment, remediation, and/or
reasonable assistance provided
The assessment task is a project. The project undertaken by the candidate must be a complex
task which involves:
• variables which are complex or unfamiliar
• relationships which need to be clarified
• a context which may be familiar or unfamiliar to the candidate
The assessment task must require the candidate to:
• analyse the task and decide on a course of action for undertaking the project
• plan and organise work and carry it through to completion
• reflect on what has been done and draw conclusions for the future
• produce evidence of meeting the aims which this graded unit has been designed to cover

J1RC 48: Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit (SCQF level 8) 8
Assessing and grading learners
The overall project will be marked out of 100. Only whole marks should be used.
The percentage of marks allocated to each stage of the project is outlined in the evidence
requirements.
It is a requirement that learners must meet the minimum evidence requirements for the
Planning stage before progressing onto the Developing stage or the Evaluating stage. Learners
may produce evidence over and above that specified in the minimum evidence requirements
and deserve more than half the available marks for that stage. Assessors should use the
grade-related criteria outlined below to judge learner performance.
Learners are required to work independently to meet the evidence requirements of the graded
unit. At the same time, learners need appropriate support. SQA uses the term reasonable
assistance to describe the balance between supporting learners in their project and not
providing too much assistance.
At the end of each stage there should be opportunities for remediation and re-assessment of
learners for that particular stage. This includes the final Evaluation stage. Any re-assessment
should be carried out in line with the centre’s own assessment policy.
Candidates who meet the minimum evidence requirements will have their achievement graded
as C – competent, or A – highly competent or B somewhere between A and C. The grade-
related criteria to be used to judge candidate performance for this graded unit is specified in the
following table.
It should be noted that in the following table the term ‘product’ could mean one of the following:
• electrical hardware only
• hardware and software
• an electrical design (which may include the use of software)
• feasibility study of a technical issue leading to a report with a clear set of recommendations
Whichever category is chosen, the project must relate to a practical situation demonstrating
how electrical engineering is utilised in the service of society.

Guidance on the Completion of the Grading Checklist
Centre staff are asked to read the following guidance notes before completing the Grading Checklist.
The checklist had been designed to help assessor(s) decide what grade should be awarded to a candidate completing the Electrical Engineering
Project. It will also be used by external moderators as part of the external verification of project work.
A Grading Checklist form should be completed for each candidate who has been entered for the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 2
(Electrical Engineering Project)
In completing the checklist, assessors should take note of the following points.
(1) For each item shown in the checklist, the Yes should be circled which most closely reflects the candidate’s performance. It can be seen from
the checklist that grade criteria for Grade C and Grade A passes have been included in the checklist and items 15 and 17 are double weighted.
(2) A Grade B should be awarded where a candidate’s performance lies approximately mid-way between a Grade C and a Grade A (ie better than
a Grade C (Competent) but not good enough to be a Grade A (Highly Competent).
(3) No grade should be awarded where a candidate’s performance is not good enough to satisfy a Grade C Pass (ie a competent level of
performance.
(4) Once centre assessor(s) have completed the 24 items, they should then apply their own professional judgement to decide what grade to award
the candidate.
(5) In arriving at the grade, due account should be taken of the distribution circles around ‘Yes’. For example, if 19 out of the 24 items have been
circled ‘Yes’ under the Grade B column and the other five have been circled under the Grade C column, then it is likely that the assessor(s) will
award the candidate a Grade B. Professional judgement is much more involved where, for example, if ‘Yes’ is circled 12 times under the Grade
A column and 12 times under the Grade B column. The assessor’s first-hand knowledge of the candidate’s performance will influence whether
the candidate is awarded Grade A or Grade B. External moderators are unlikely to overturn the grading awarded by the centre assessor(s)
unless they are not happy that grading judgements have been awarded in a fair, consistent and rigorous manner.
(6) Centre’s may provide additional comments and/or evidence in support of their grading decisions.SQA Advanced Unit Specification
General information for centres
Unit title: Employment Experience 2
Unit code: HR1D 47
Unit purpose: This Unit is designed to enable candidates to demonstrate that they can, in
their normal work environment, work with others to complete a task. It is intended for
candidates who are in employment and who are undertaking a course of study relevant to
their occupational role with the support of their employer or who may wish to develop their
career prospects. On completion of the Unit candidates should be able to:
1. Analyse and plan a workplace task in co-operation with others
2. Implement a workplace task in co-operation with others
3. Evaluate own contribution to the completion of a workplace task
Credit value: 1 SQA Credit at SCQF level 7: (8 SCQF credit points at SCQF level 7)
SCQF (the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework) brings Scottish qualifications into a single
framework of 12 levels ranging from SQA National 1 to doctorates. The SCQF includes degrees; SQA
Advanced Certificates and Diplomas; SQA National Qualifications; and SVQs. Each SQA Unit is allocated a
number of SCQF credit points at a specific level. 1 SCQF point = 10 hours of learning. SQA Advanced
candidates are normally expected to input a further number of hours, matched to the credit value of the Unit, of
non-contact time or candidate-led effort to consolidate and reinforce learning.
Recommended prior knowledge and skills: Candidates should have good
interpersonal skills. These may be demonstrated by the achievement of the core skill
Working with Others at Intermediate 2 or by possession of a suitable SQA Advanced Unit at
SCQF level 7 involving oral communication or equivalent. Candidates should have some
work experience and should be in employment at the time the Unit is undertaken.
Core skills: The core skill of Working with Others at SCQF level 6 is embedded in this
Unit.
Context for delivery: This Unit is included in the framework of a number of SQA
Advanced Certificates and SQA Advanced Diplomas. It is recommended that it should be
delivered and assessed within the subject area of the group award to which it contributes.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HR1D 47: Employment Experience 2 2
August 2017
Assessment: The Unit could be assessed holistically by a portfolio of evidence generated
by the candidate at his/her place of work. Much of the evidence should arise naturally out of
the task which the candidate chooses for the Unit but it will also include reflective statements
by the candidate on his/her experience. These statements should be confirmed by others
involved who could also provide other witness testimony to support the candidate’s
performance. Since the core skill component of Working with Others is embedded in this
Unit, it is strongly recommended that you follow the assessment guidelines given. If you
wish to use a different assessment model you should seek prior moderation of the assessment
instrument(s) you intend to use to ensure that the core skill component is still covered.
An Assessment Exemplar and Guidelines on the Delivery of the Unit have been produced to
indicate the national standards of achievement required at SCQF level 7.

The assessment of this Outcome can be combined with Outcomes 1 and 3 as part of a single
assessment instrument for the Unit, details of which are given under Outcome 3 below.
Outcome 3
Evaluate own contribution to the completion of a workplace task
Knowledge and/or skills
• importance of analysing personal strengths and weaknesses
• value of identifying personal lessons for the future
• methods of obtaining feedback from others
Evidence requirements
These should be read in conjunction with the evidence requirements for Outcomes 1 and 2
which set out the requirements of the task. The workplace task should be the same task which
the candidate helped to analyse, plan and implement in Outcomes 1 and 2.
Each candidate will need evidence to show that s/he can evaluate his/her contribution of the
completion of a workplace task. The evidence must show that s/he can evaluate areas of
strength and weakness in his/her own contribution to co-operative working during the
analysis, planning and implementation of the workplace task. The evidence should consist of:
1. A personal report by the candidate evaluating his/her own contribution to the analysis,
planning and implementation of the task including identification of his/her strengths and
weaknesses with respect to the contribution he/she has made. The evaluation of the
contribution should include how well the candidate collaborated with others and
identified ways of enhancing collaborative work, ie working more effectively with others
in the future.
The evidence provided must cover each of the knowledge and/or skills items and must show
that the candidate is able to:
• identify his/her strengths and weaknesses with respect to the contribution that s/he made to
the analysis, planning and implementation of the task. The emphasis should be on how
well the candidate worked with others and each candidate should consider this in the light
of the analysis, planning and implementation of the task and the extent to which the
objectives of the task were met
• identify lessons for her/his future performance in similar situations. These should be based
on ways in which, with hindsight, s/he could have acted to improve overall group
performance through the way in which s/he worked with others
• make reference to specific feedback gained from others to support the evaluation of her/his
own contribution to the planning and implementation of the task.

Assessment guidelines
The assessment of this Outcome can be combined with Outcomes 1 and 2 as part of a single
assessment of the Unit.
The workplace task may be one with which the candidate is involved as part of their normal
working environment on a regular or an occasional basis. It could, however, be one in which
the candidate participates for the purposes of this Unit.
It could involve improving workplace performance in some way, for example, by
investigating a particular situation or designing or inventing a new approach to work
procedures. Alternatively, it could involve organising a particular event, eg a work
experience programme for school pupils.
Each candidate could prepare a portfolio of evidence to demonstrate that s/he can fulfil the
requirements of the Unit. To meet the evidence requirements, it could be laid out in the
following sections:
1. A statement of the workplace task undertaken by the candidate.
2. The two personal reports by the candidate explaining his/her contribution to:
a) analysis and planning
b) implementation of the workplace task
3. Witness testimonies to confirm that the personal reports are a true record of what took

SQA Advanced Unit specification: support notes
Unit title: Employment Experience 2
This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not
mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
design length is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
The Unit is intended for candidates who are in employment and who are taking a
qualification at SQA Advanced level in conjunction with their occupational role and with the
support of their employer. It also provides an opportunity to overtake the core skill Working
with Others at SCQF level 5. Most of the evidence required will be generated by candidates
as part of their normal course of employment. They will thus need the co-operation of their
employer and the Unit is not suitable for candidates who are unable or unwilling to seek their
assistance.
The Unit is expressed in generic terms but it should be related to a context which is familiar
to candidates. As a result, the task selected should be one which is related to the candidate’s
normal occupational role. Tasks concerned with improving performance are likely to be
particularly suitable, although tasks requiring organisation of an event may also be
appropriate. It is likely to be easier for candidates if the task is related to a specific activity,
eg arranging the installation of new equipment; piloting new work procedures; investigating
the cause of operational difficulties; looking into a complaint from a customer; benchmarking
a process; evaluating the potential of new hardware or software; organising training in new
procedures; arranging a workplace social event.
A further key element is that the task chosen must involve others. It would be acceptable,
therefore, for the tasks to be one assigned to a group which includes the candidate such as a
project team, a working party or a committee. It is not necessary for the candidate to have a
managerial role in the group but s/he must be able to make a realistic and significant
contribution to the analysis, planning and implementation of the task.
Ideally, the task should be one in which the candidate would participate during the normal
course of events at work. However, in order to get a meaningful task, it may be necessary to
deliberately co-opt the candidate onto a group or to institute a specific activity with which the
candidate can be involved.
The task should be one where the overall objective is clear, eg find the cause of a quality
problem; arrange work experience for local school pupils. However, the possible components
of the task are not specified and, indeed may not be immediately obvious. Thus, the task will
have to be analysed by the candidate in conjunction with others.
In broad terms, the Unit covers the planning and implementation of the task. There are no
requirements as to how these stages are conducted. Finally, the candidate is required to
evaluate his/her own contribution to the planning and control of the task from the perspective
of working with others.

The following notes give some additional information on each Outcome:
Outcome 1: stages of planning include define objectives; generate and evaluate options;
identify components/activities; sequence components/activities, (eg by using methods such as
a Gantt chart); identify resources; review the plan; monitor and control.
Outcome 2: group decisions could be by consensus, majority, negotiation or by authority; the
process of monitoring and control involves setting standards, measuring performance;
comparing it with the standards and taking any corrective action deemed necessary. Legal
and organisational requirements are likely to revolve around health and safety obligations.
Outcome 3: methods of obtaining feedback may be formal, (eg appraisal; customer feedback
questionnaires as part of a quality system) or informal, (eg comments from others). They may
be written or oral and may be solicited or unsolicited.
Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
Candidates will require guidance from a centre to ensure that they adopt a suitable approach
to the Unit. Centres will also have to allow time to monitor the progress of candidates and for
assessment of the candidate portfolios. The number of formal time-tabled hours for
candidates, however, is likely to be small. The Unit is particularly suitable, therefore, in
situations where there is little leeway between the recommended number of teaching hours
for an award and the maximum number of hours during which candidates can attend.
Centres may find it advisable to appoint a mentor for the candidate. This should be someone
at the candidate’s place of work who can monitor progress and who can confirm the
authenticity of the personal reports submitted by candidates. Mentors may also be able to
suggest suitable tasks for candidates. If centres do take this approach, it may be helpful to
arrange some induction training for mentors prior to the commencement of the Unit. In these
circumstances, mentors could be given training to help them keep a watching on portfolios.
This may help to reduce the burden of portfolio assessment for the centre by ensuring, for
example, that portfolios contain all the requisite evidence.
Centres may wish to develop a ‘shell’ portfolio which can be used as a template for
candidates and for mentors. It could include samples of personal reports and acceptable work
related evidence.
It may also be possible to combine this Unit with others, eg if candidates have to undertake a
work project in which others are involved.
Open learning
This Unit is well suited to delivery by distance learning. It may be helpful to confirm
beforehand with the candidate that s/he has chosen a suitable workplace task for the Unit.
The portfolio, once completed, could be sent directly to the assessor.
For information on normal open learning arrangements, please refer to the SQA guide
Assessment and Quality Assurance of Open and Distance Learning (SQA, 2000).

General information for candidates
Unit title: Employment Experience 2
This Unit is designed to enable you to make use of your experience at work to overtake the
core skill of Working with Others at SCQF level 7. To complete the Unit you must
participate in a workplace task involving others and keep records of the planning and the
implementation of the task.
It will be up to you to choose a suitable task, although the centre and your work will help you
to do this. In deciding what task to pick, you should bear three main things in mind:
1. The task must be one that involves others, eg a project team, a working party. You do not
have to be the leader of the group but you do have to play an active role in it. You can, if
you wish, choose a task for which you are responsible, but, if you do, it must be one that
requires you to work co-operatively with others.
2. The task must be one that has a clear objective, (eg investigating a quality problem;
organising a training event). However, the exact components that make up the task will
not be clear and it will be up to those involved, including yourself, to decide what the
actual components of the task ought to be.
3. The task may be part of your normal working role or it can be a ‘one-off’ task in which
you participate purely for the purpose of completing this Unit.
Overall, the task is an opportunity for you to use your experience at work for your personal
development. You may wish to discuss the best type to choose with your line manager or
with someone else at work.
As noted already, the main focus of the Unit is working with others during the analysis,
planning and implementation stages of a task. However, you must also evaluate your
experience. This means that you must reflect on what happened and draw conclusions about
how well you have worked with others on this task and about how you would work more
effectively with other people on future occasions.
In order to complete this Unit successfully, you must provide evidence to prove that you can
work co-operatively with others. The evidence required is:
1. A statement of the workplace task in which you participated. It should include an
explanation of the context of the task, (eg why it was undertaken; at whose instigation,
etc), the nature of your role in the task and the others involved in it.
2. Two personal reports written by yourself which explain your contribution to a) the
analysis and planning and b) the implementation of the workplace task and how this
involved co-operatively with others. Both these reports must be confirmed as a true
record of what took place by someone who is responsible for your work or for the chosen
task, eg the leader of your group; your line manager. Normally, the person will make a
signed statement which should be included in your portfolio.
3. A personal report evaluating your contribution to the planning and implementation of the
workplace task.

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit has been designed as a freestanding Unit. The Unit should be delivered towards the
end of the award, students having previously completed the SQA Advanced Units Single
Phase A.C. Circuits, Electrical Networks and Resonance and Mathematics for Engineering 1:
Electronics and Electrical.
The Unit has been designed to incorporate sufficient time to allow lecturers to teach all the
electrical and electronic principles contained in the Unit. There is sufficient time to include
the use of formative assessment exercises. Although there is no practical assessment, it would
be very useful if candidates undertook laboratory work and computer simulation throughout
the Unit to support theory and avoid the delivery of the Unit becoming too theoretical. For
example, candidates could undertake experimental work on examples of open circuit, short
circuit and matched lines, particularly set within an electronics context.
Details on approaches to assessment are given under Evidence Requirements and Assessment
guidelines under each Outcome in the SQA Advanced Unit Specification: Statement of
Standards section. It is recommended that these sections be read carefully before proceeding
with assessment of candidates.
The content of this Unit is such that it should be assessed by one holistic assessment
instrument and this should be carried out at the end of the Unit delivery time.
Open learning
This Unit could be delivered by distance learning, which may incorporate some degree of on-
line support. However, with regard to assessment, planning would be required by the centre
concerned to ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence. Arrangements
would be required to be put in place to ensure that assessment was conducted under
controlled, supervised conditions.
For information on normal open learning arrangements, please refer to the SQA guide
Assessment and Quality Assurance of Open and Distance Learning (SQA 2000).
Equality and inclusion
This Unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative
evidence.

This Unit has been designed to allow you to develop your knowledge, understanding and
skills in the principles and concepts of transmission lines and complex waves. It can be
delivered, as a stand alone Unit but it would be beneficial if you have completed the SQA
Advanced Units Single Phase A.C. Circuits, Electrical Networks and Resonance and
Mathematics for Engineering 1: Electronics and Electrical.
By the end of the Unit, you should be able to solve through calculation and graphical analysis;
electrical quantities associated with transmission lines and secondly, solve simple electronic
circuit problems involving complex waveforms.
In Outcome 1, you will be introduced to different types of transmission line. You will also
learn how a transmission line can be represented by electrical quantities and how to determine
the secondary parameters of a line.
In Outcome 2, you will use the parameters introduced in Outcome 1 to calculate by the use of
equations, voltage, current and power in a transmission line with a matched termination.
In Outcome 3, you will use equations and graphical methods to determine values of voltage,
current and power for a transmission line with various terminations.
In Outcome 4, you will learn about complex waveforms and how to solve various electrical
quantities in an R – L - C and an R – L // C circuit when a complex wave is applied.
Although there is no practical assessment in this Unit, it is likely that laboratory work and
computer simulation will be used to support the theory.
The Unit will be assessed by one written assessment at one assessment event. Your lecturer
should inform you how the Unit will be assessed. The assessment will take place at the end of
the Unit and shall last two hours under controlled, supervised conditions. You will not be

the four technologies and factors associated with traditional methods of energy production.
The evidence should be responses to specific questions.
To ensure that learners will not be able to foresee all the items they will be questioned about,
a different sample should be used on successive assessment occasions. The new sample
may contain a maximum of one of the Knowledge and/or Skills used in the previous
assessment occasion.
A learner’s response can be judged to be satisfactory where the evidence shows that the
learner can:

Unit Support Notes are offered as guidance and are not mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
design length is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
This Unit is designed to introduce some of the current and emerging or less common
technologies used in energy production. Traditional methods (coal, oil, gas and nuclear) and
renewable methods (wind, solar, hydro and biomass) will be described in terms of principle of
operation, system components, operational aspects and environmental and sustainability
factors. Emerging and less common technologies (tidal, wave, geothermal and waste) will be
described in terms of principle of operation, system components, operational aspects and
environmental and sustainability factors.
Outcome 1
It is suggested that the following technologies be used in the delivery of this Outcome:
Coal: Pulverised coal combustion (PCC)
Gas: Combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)
Oil: Crude oil combined cycle
Nuclear: Pressurised water reactors (PWR)
For each of the four technologies, diagrams should be used showing the key components in
the energy conversion process from input through to output. Each stage in the process
should be explained in terms of its function/operation. Operational aspects should include
typical overall plant efficiencies, start-up time, utilisation for base or peak loads, reliability of
supply and CO2 emissions per Unit of energy generated (gCO2/kWh). Environmental and
sustainability factors and the significance of each will vary depending on the technology but
would typically include several of the following:
• Use of finite fossil fuels
• CO2 released into atmosphere
• Visual amenity and noise impacts
• Air, land and water pollution
• Impact on wildlife and ecological systems
• Health and safety
• Waste products

Outcome 2
For each of the technologies, diagrams should be used showing the key components in the
energy conversion process from input through to output. Each stage in the process should be
explained in terms of its function/operation. Operational aspects should include typical overall
plant (or Unit) efficiency, weather constraints, logistics (for offshore wind), reliability of supply
and CO2 emissions per Unit of energy generated (gCO2/kWh). Environmental and
sustainability factors and the significance of each will vary depending on the technology but
would typically include several of the following:
• Use of renewable resources
• CO2 released into atmosphere
• Visual amenity and noise impacts
• Air, land and water pollution
• Land-loss (large hydro schemes in particular)
• Impact on wildlife, marine life and ecological systems
• Waste products
Outcome 3
Marine (wave and tidal) technologies are expected to contribute to the future energy ‘mix’. At
present, worldwide there are only a few operational marine power plants. Technologies to
harness energy from the tide include tidal barrage and tidal stream. The European Marine
Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney is one of the world’s leading marine technology research
and testing centres and a useful source of information. Currently, there are several types of
wave energy technologies at various stages of development. In the UK, examples include the
‘Pelamis’ attenuator system, the ‘Limpet’ oscillating water column system and the ‘Oyster’
oscillating wave surge convertor system. Energy production from geothermal sources utilises
three main technologies and currently the US is the largest producer of geothermal energy.
Historically, energy from waste has been via incineration however more recent technologies
such as gasification and pyrolysis are now being commissioned. It is suggested that the
following technologies be used in the delivery of this Outcome:
Tidal: Tidal barrage and Tidal stream
Wave: Attenuator systems, Oscillating water column systems and Oscillating wave
surge convertor systems
Geothermal: Dry steam, Flash steam and Binary cycle
Waste: Incineration and Advanced Thermal Treatments (Gasification and Pyrolysis)
SQA Advanced Unit Specification

For each of the technologies, diagrams should be used showing the key components in the
energy conversion process from input through to output. Each stage in the process should be
explained in terms of its function/operation. Operational aspects should include typical overall
plant (or Unit) efficiency (where data is available), logistics (for waste), reliability of supply
and CO2 emissions per Unit of energy generated (gCO2/kWh). Environmental and
sustainability factors and the significance of each will vary depending on the technology but
would typically include several of the following:
• Use of renewable/sustainable resources
• CO2 released into atmosphere
• Visual amenity and noise impacts
• Air, land and water pollution
• Impact on wildlife, marine life and ecological systems (tidal barrage in particular)
• Waste products
Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
This Unit should be delivered in year 2 of an SQA Advanced Diploma programme. It would
be beneficial if learners had previously completed the level 7 Unit Energy Overview. It is
unlikely that it could be delivered through integration with other Units.
It would be beneficial if learners had classroom internet access. It is suggested that an equal
amount of time be allocated to each Outcome.
Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment. The following are
suggestions only. There may be other methods that would be more suitable to learners.
All Outcomes should be assessed on a sample basis.
Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
work or further and higher education.
The Unit may be assessed on an Outcome by Outcome basis or through a combination of
Outcomes.
Outcome 1
This Outcome may be assessed individually or in combination with Outcomes 2 and/or 3.
Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
conditions.
Outcome 2
This Outcome may be assessed individually or in combination with Outcomes 1 and/or 3.
Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
conditions.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HT1L 48, Energy Technologies (SCQF level 8) 9
Outcome 3
This Outcome may be assessed individually or in combination with Outcomes 1 and/or 2.
Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
conditions.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
Some Core Skills may be developed through the delivery of this Unit.
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) may be developed in all Unit Outcomes
and in particular, the use of the internet to search for flowcharts, block diagrams and
animations associated with each of the technologies.

General information for learners
Unit title: Energy Technologies
This section will help you decide whether this is the Unit for you by explaining what the Unit
is about, what you should know or be able to do before you start, what you will need to do
during the Unit and opportunities for further learning and employment.
The Unit is designed to introduce a range of technologies associated with energy production.
The technologies will be classified as traditional, renewable, and emerging and less common
sustainable methods, for the purposes of this Unit. Traditional (existing) methods are based
upon fossil fuel technologies and nuclear. Renewable methods are based upon the utilisation
of non-fossil fuel based technologies. Emerging and less common sustainable methods are
based upon technologies that are currently at various stages of development, implementation
or operation together with technologies that are operational but are, overall, small energy
producers relative to traditional and renewable methods.
The Unit is optional for learners on related SQA Advanced Engineering Awards. It could also
be used as a stand-alone Unit where appropriate. No prior knowledge is required although it
would be beneficial if learners have previously completed the level 7 Unit Energy Overview
and were familiar with using the internet for research purposes.
Outcome 1 has been designed to introduce traditional methods of energy production using
coal, gas, oil and nuclear fuel sources. Typical power plant operation and processes will be
explained detailing energy input through to energy output. Operational aspects,
environmental and sustainability issues and numerical calculations pertaining to each
technology will also be considered.
Outcome 2 has been designed to introduce renewable methods of energy production using
wind, hydro, solar and biomass technologies. Typical power plant or device operation and
processes will be explained detailing energy input through to energy output. Operational
aspects, environmental and sustainability issues and numerical calculations pertaining to
each technology will also be considered.
Outcome 3 has been designed to introduce emerging and/or less common sustainable
methods of energy production. Tidal, wave, geothermal and waste technologies will be
considered. Typical power plant or device operation and processes will be explained
detailing energy input through to energy output. Operational aspects and environmental and
sustainability issues pertaining to each technology will also be considered.
In order to achieve this Unit, all Outcomes must be achieved. This Unit will be assessed by
responses to structured questions under closed-book conditions.
There is no automatic certification of Core Skills or Core Skill components in this Unit.
The Unit has been designed to support articulation routes to degree programmes and also to
support employment opportunities in the energy sector.SQA Advanced Unit Specification

Unit title: Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development
Unit code: HP3H 48
Unit purpose: This Unit is designed to enable candidates to recognise and evaluate the
external factors affecting the performance of companies in the modern business environment.
It also provides candidates with the opportunity to identify and assess the internal measures
companies are taking in order to respond to external business pressures. The Unit also allows
candidates to recognise the importance that continued learning and Continuing Professional
Development will play in the development of their careers in a rapidly changing business
environment. This recognition is reinforced in that candidates are provided with the opportunity
to develop a Continuing Professional Development Action Plan
The Unit has been expressed in generic terms and is thus appropriate for a wide range of
candidates pursuing different vocational/professional careers.
On completion of the Unit candidates should be able to:
1. Evaluate the key external factors affecting either positively or negatively the
sustainability and profitability of companies operating in the modern business
environment.
2. Evaluate internal measures companies have taken in response to external pressures for
change.
3. Develop a Personal Continuing Professional Development Action Plan.
Credit value: 1 SQA Credit at SCQF level 8: (8 SCQF credit points at SCQF level 8*)
*SCQF credit points are used to allocate credit to qualifications in the Scottish Credit and Qualifications
Framework (SCQF). Each qualification in the Framework is allocated a number of SCQF credit points at an
SCQF level. There are 12 SCQF levels, ranging from National 1 to Doctorates.
Recommended prior knowledge and skills: Candidates should have good
communication skills. These may be demonstrated by achievement of core skill
Communication at Higher level or by possession of Higher English and Communication or a
suitable SQA Advanced Communication Unit (SCQF level 7) such as Communication:
Practical Skills. It would be beneficial if candidates have some work experience but this is not
essential.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP3H 48: Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development 2
Core skills: There may be opportunities to gather evidence towards Core Skills in this Unit,
although there is no automatic certification of Core Skills or Core Skills components.
Context for delivery: This Unit was originally designed to be included in the SQA
Advanced Engineering Framework of awards but has been written in generic terms so that it
may be included in a number of SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma group
awards. It is recommended that it should be taught and assessed within the context of the
particular group award to which it contributes.
Assessment: With regard to Outcomes 1 and 2 a Case Study should be used to assess both
outcomes. Candidates should write a report based on questions developed around the Case
Study. The report should be 1200 -1500 words in length. Candidates should be allowed 14-
days to complete the report from the date the Case Study is issued to them by their lecturer.
The assessment for Outcome 3 should involve candidates in developing their own Continuing
Professional Development Action Plan. Centres may choose to develop a pro forma for the
Action Plan which all candidates use or allow candidates to present the Action Plan in their
own format. Candidates should be allowed 14-days to complete the Action Plan from the date
it is issued to them by their lecturer.
In the case of both the Action Plan and Case Study centres should make every reasonable effort
to ensure that candidates submit their own work. Where copying or plagiarism is suspected
centres may wish to interview a candidate(s) to check her/his knowledge and understanding of
the subject matter. A checklist should be used to record oral evidence of the candidate’s
knowledge and understanding.

Evidence requirements for Outcomes 1 and 2
Each candidate will need to provide evidence that she/he can, with reference to a particular
company, evaluate both the positive and negative impact of external factors affecting the
profitability and sustainability of the company. In addition, each candidate will also have to
make an accurate and clear evaluation of the internal measures the company has taken to
maintain profitability and sustainability in the face of external drivers for change. A Case Study
should be used for assessment purposes
Evidence for the knowledge and/or skills items in both Outcomes 1 and 2 will be provided on
a sample basis. The number of items to be sampled in both Outcomes 1 and 2 is five out of
nine. The evidence should be presented in response to a specific questions based on the Case
Study. In order to ensure that candidates will not be able to foresee what items they will be
questioned on, a different sample of five out the nine knowledge and/or skills items in both
Outcomes 1 and 2 is required each time the Outcome is assessed. Candidates must provide a
satisfactory response to the five items sampled from Outcome 1 and the five items sampled
from Outcome 2.
Where sampling takes place, a candidate's response can be judged to be satisfactory where the
evidence provided is sufficient to meet the requirements by showing that the candidate is able
to:

Unit specification: support notes
Unit title: Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development
This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not
mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
design length is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
This Unit has been written in order to allow candidates to examine the following: -
(1) the various external factors that are currently impacting either positively or negatively
on the sustainability and profitability of companies.
(2) the ways in which companies are responding internally to meet the challenges of a
rapidly changing business environment.
(3) the best way for individuals to plan their future learning and development in order to
develop the necessary knowledge and skills to work in the modern business
environment.
It is acknowledged that the Unit content is potentially broad and it is important that candidates
are provided with appropriate guidance as to which aspects of external and internal factors
affecting companies and learning they should primarily focus on. Nevertheless, candidates
should not be unnecessarily inhibited from investigating areas of interest to them that are not
contained within the formal learning and teaching process.
Outcomes 1 and 2 have been written primarily with private sector business organisations in
mind but a number of the knowledge and/or skills items, particularly in Outcome 2, can equally
be applied to public sector and voluntary organisations. Lecturers may find it beneficial during
the delivery of the Unit to illustrate how some of these items apply to public sector and
voluntary organisations (e.g. with reference to public sector organisations adopting practices
from the private sector).
One of the main purposes of this Unit is to encourage candidates to think carefully about the
future learning and qualifications they undertake with a view to planning future career options.
It will be important to highlight to candidates the fact that their careers may change
direction a number of times during their working life and it is thus important that they have the
necessary learning and qualifications to meet these changes. Such changes may well be beyond
the candidates' control, being, for example, a result of changes in the work place, so it is
important that clear connections are drawn between the work in Outcomes 1 and 2 and that in
Outcome 3.
Whilst the Unit has been written in generic terms, it should be set within the context which is
familiar to candidates. For example, for students studying a SQA Advanced Engineering award
the Unit could be related to the context in which incorporated engineers work in industry. If
necessary the terminology used in the Unit can be adapted to suit the relevant work place.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP3H 48: Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development 9
The Unit is likely to be delivered to both candidates with little or no work experience and those
with significant work experience. With regard to the latter type of candidates it is important
that they are provided with opportunities to reflect on their work place experience with a view
to setting it in context with changes in the modern business environment. This should provide
a very good platform for these candidates to enhance their own learning. In classes where both
candidates with little or no work experience and those with significant work experience are
present, it may be helpful to draw on the knowledge, experiences and ideas of the latter
candidates to promote discussions which allow modern work place experience to be set in some
kind of context.
Outcome 1 looks at the various external factors that may influence a company's
competitiveness and sustainability. Such factors may include company size, position in the
supply chain, opportunities for product/service innovation and development*, the market sector
the company is operating in, product/service life cycles, globalisation of the market place,
impact of Internet and e-commerce, economic factors, rapid technological change and
environmental factors. It is not suggested that candidates should consider the financial
condition of the company in any depth, as this is rightly a subject in its own right. However,
some reference to the current financial position of the company in terms of its ability to sustain
long-term profitability may be useful. Candidates should become familiar with the relevant
terminology and should use it when describing various situations. One approach to delivering
this Outcome would be to encourage candidates to consider the factors shown above as they
may apply to a company in the sector area the candidate is likely to work in. One possibility
would be to look at, say, a company in one of the following three categories: a small company
(typically11 to 50 employees), a medium size company (typically 51 to 250 employees) or a
large company (above 250 employees). Alternatively, for those candidates currently in
employment there may be value in applying the factors shown above to the company they work
for.
* This may be an external factor because the level of product innovation and design in a
company may be controlled by head office, which might operate, for example, in another
country.
It may be helpful in delivering Outcome 1 to make use of some kind of conceptual framework
tool to assist in the evaluation of a company's current strategies and competitive performance.
An example of such a conceptual framework is the Puttick Grid that was developed by the
Warwick Manufacturing Group for the engineering and manufacturing sectors.
In Outcome 2, candidates should examine approaches companies have taken to respond to
changes in the external business environment. Such approaches could include improved long
term strategic and operational planning, new product and service developments, changes to
organisational structures, efficiency measures (including outsourcing parts of the business),
increased customer focus, application of ICT (Information and Communications Technology),
new working practices, increased use of technology (eg automation, lean production), and
internal and external training.
When considering new product and/or service developments it may be helpful to include a
discussion of the cost implications of introducing any new product or service. It may be useful
to explain to candidates the importance of balancing these costs against, say, the failure to
introduce new products or services (eg market drop-off of existing products and/or services
leading to fall-off in profitability).
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP3H 48: Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development 10
In considering organisational structures there may be value in providing candidates with details
of the types of structure that can exist in companies such as hierarchical versus, flat, centralised
versus decentralised, divisional versus functional, product versus service, hybrid and matrix
structures. It may also be helpful to highlight the increasingly important role that teams are
playing in many companies operations.
It may be beneficial to look at the increasingly important role ICT is playing in many companies
by looking at examples of where ICT is used to enhance performance in such areas as
communications, marketing and product and stock control.
In Outcome 3 candidates should be provided with the opportunity to explore the process of
learning and the different learning styles that people can adopt. It is intended that a
consideration of learning and learning styles will provide the platform for developing an initial
Personal Continuing Professional Development Action Plan which will require updating
periodically as candidates careers progress. It is acknowledged that the subject of learning and
learning styles is very large and it will be necessary to be selective in what areas are chosen.
With regards to learning it may be useful to look at the ideas relating to deep and surface
learning. It may also be useful to look at the work of Tony Buzan. It may also be helpful to
consider potential barriers to learning.
With regard to learning styles there may be value in allowing candidates to complete a learning
styles questionnaire, such as the one developed by Honey and Mumford, so they can ascertain
their preferred learning style(s).
Other work that is likely to be required before candidates can develop their Continuing
Professional Development Action Plan includes the following:
(1) explanation of the differences between formal, semi-formal and informal learning
(2) CPD schemes offered by relevant professional bodies
(3) the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework
(4) range of qualifications options available in the vocational area(s) the candidates are
likely to work
(5) advantages and disadvantages of different sources of learning including, class based
learning, work-based learning and distance and/or on-line learning opportunities
Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit is a core Unit within all SQA Advanced Diploma Engineering awards. As such the
Unit should be delivered in the context of the modern business environment and the importance
of learning as it applies to the engineering and manufacturing sectors in general and the area
of engineering covered by the award in particular. Given the content of the Unit, particularly
that relating to learning and future career planning, it is recommended that the Unit be delivered
towards the end of an SQA Advanced Diploma Engineering award.
Where the Unit is incorporated into other group awards it is recommended that it be delivered
in the context of the specific occupational area(s) that the award is designed to cover. As in the
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP3H 48: Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development 11
case of the SQA Advanced Diploma Engineering awards it is recommended that for the reasons
already given that the Unit be delivered towards the end of the award.
This Unit has been designed to promote the development of investigative, analytical and critical
thinking skills. It is important that candidates are provided with the appropriate support to
develop these skills. This support may come in the form of individual or group support from
the lecturer delivering the Unit, through group activities, or with reference to appropriate
textbooks, reports or papers or from some other source(s) of information or knowledge.
Reports, papers and other sources of information may be accessed via a number of different
web sites operated by the following: Scottish Executive, Scottish Enterprise, United Kingdom
Government, Labour Market Research Organisations, and Sector Skills Councils relating to the
occupational area or Professional Bodies relating to the occupational area. It is important that
the information on these web sites is checked regularly as new information on such areas as
market trends, labour market and skills shortage forecasts etc. becomes available all the time.
Details on approaches to assessment are given under Evidence Requirements and Assessment
guidelines under each Outcome in the SQA Advanced Unit specification: statement of
standards section. It is recommended that these sections be read carefully before proceeding
with assessment of candidates.
Open learning
This Unit could be delivered by distance learning, which may incorporate some degree of on-
line support. However, with regard to assessment, planning would be required by the centre
concerned to ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence.
For information on normal open learning arrangements, please refer to the SQA guide
Assessment and Quality Assurance of Open and Distance Learning (SQA 2000).
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative
evidence.
Further advice can be found on our website www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.

Unit HP3H 48: Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development 12
General information for candidates
Unit title: Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development
This Unit has been designed to allow you to identify and evaluate the importance of external
factors affecting modern companies. Such factors include scope for product/service innovation
and development, level of competition both nationally and internationally, impact of the
Internet and e-commerce and technological changes.
This Unit will also provide you with an opportunity to examine ways that companies have
responded internally to the pressures from external factors. Such internal responses may
include organisational restructuring, new working practices, greater customer focus, increased
use of Information and Communication Technologies and Technology generally and better
internal and external training.
It will become increasingly necessary for you to develop new knowledge and skills if you are
to keep in employment and develop your career when working in such a rapidly changing
business environment. Thus, the Unit also allows you the opportunity to examine the best ways
for you to learn new knowledge and skills and to develop an initial Continuing Professional
Development Action Plan for future learning and career development beyond your SQA
Advanced course.
It is likely that during the teaching of the Unit you will be provided with, or have to obtain
through investigation, significant amounts of information relevant to modern business practices
and learning. You will be required to analyse this information and judge its value in supporting
any views you wish to put forward. Thus, another benefit of taking the Unit is that you will be
encouraged to develop or enhance new skills in investigation, analysis and critical thinking.
You should not be concerned if you have little or no knowledge of how modern companies
operate as you will be provided with case study materials to illustrate how they work. If you
do have previous experience, or are currently in employment, your lecturer may encourage you
to use this knowledge to set the information you receive during the teaching of the Unit in some
kind of context. They may also ask you to share this knowledge with the rest of your class so
that others can benefit from your experiences.
By the end of the Unit you will be expected to have a clearer understanding of the external
factors affecting modern companies and how companies have responded internally to meet
these external pressures for change. You will also be expected to have a greater appreciation
of the importance of learning and Continuing Professional Development in your future career
development and to have developed an initial Continuing Professional Development Action
Plan.
The assessment for this Unit will involve a Case Study for Outcomes 1 and 2 and a Continuing
Professional Development Action Plan for Outcome 3. With regard to the Case Study you will
be required to complete a report based on questions around the Case Study. The report length
should be between 1200 and 1500 words. You will be given 14-days to complete the report
from the date it is issued to you by your lecturer.
The Continuing Professional Development Plan will provide you with an opportunity to plan
your career over the next 3 to 5 years. The Centre where you are studying may provide you
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP3H 48: Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development 13
with a pro forma for this Action Plan or you may be allowed to complete it in your own format.
You will be allowed 14-days to complete the Action Plan from the date it is issued to you by
your lecturer.SQA Advanced Unit Specification

Unit specification: support notes
Unit title: Power Supply Circuits
This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not
mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
design length is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
This Unit has been written in order to allow candidates to develop knowledge, understanding
and skills in the following areas:
1. Unregulated full wave rectification and smoothing methods and the use of equations
to calculate voltage and component values.
2. Explain the need for a stable, regulated power supply with protection and how such

regulated and switched mode power supplies.
This Unit has been developed as part of a group of Principles and Technology Units within the
SQA Advanced Diploma in Electronic award.
In designing this Unit the Unit writers have identified the range of topics they would expect to
be covered by lecturers. The writers have also given recommendations as to how much time
should be spent on each Outcome. This has been done to help lecturers to decide what depth
of treatment should be given to the topics attached to each of the Outcomes. Whilst it is not
mandatory for centres to use this list of topics it is strongly recommended that they do so to
ensure continuity of teaching and learning across the Electronic principles Units. In addition,
the assessment exemplar pack for this Unit is based on the knowledge and/or skills and list of
topics in each of the Outcomes.
A list of topics is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list of topics in conjunction
with the assessment exemplar pack so that they can get a clear indication of the standard of

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit may be taught as a free standing Unit, however it also could be combined with
appropriate Unit(s) to allow integration of practical assessment.
The Unit is aimed at building on existing bridge rectifier knowledge before introducing the
linear regulated power supply and the switched mode power supply. It is worth noting that both
of these topics cover a wide range of circuit and device types and that the content and context
of this Unit is aimed at equipping the candidate with fundamental knowledge and basic design
tools
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP3T 48: Power Supply Circuits 10
Delivery of Outcome 1 should provide candidates with the opportunity to build rectifier
circuits, determine and test smoothing capacitor and output voltage values. Candidates with
prior experience may prefer to simulate circuits if suitable software is available.
Delivery of Outcomes 2 and 3 should focus on the theory of linear and switched mode power
supplies. Candidates should be given opportunities to calculate parameters and demonstrate
understanding.
Delivery of Outcome 4 should be started as soon as convenient and combined with the delivery
of Outcome two and three. It is expected that data sheets for both the linear regulator and
switched mode power supply practical circuits be introduced at an early stage to allow the
candidates maximum time to become familiar with these components. The practical circuits
are expected to be of simple, low voltage design to allow safe working. Candidates are to be
encouraged to simulate their designs using appropriate software packages prior to construction,
however assessment must be based on the working practical circuits.
Assessment of this Unit falls into two parts. One written assessment paper towards the end of
the Unit under controlled, supervised conditions and one practical assignment integrated into
the Unit delivery.
Open learning
This Unit could be delivered on an open learning basis. The centre would have to ensure that
the written assessment was carried out under controlled and supervised conditions. In addition
the authenticity of any practical assignment carried out, out with the centre, would need to be
provided.
For information on normal open learning arrangements, please refer to the SQA guide
Assessment and Quality of Open and Distance Learning (SQA 2000).
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative
evidence.

Unit HP3T 48: Power Supply Circuits 11
General information for candidates
Unit title: Power Supply Circuits
The topic of power supply circuits is immense. As such one Unit cannot do justice to the
breadth of the topic. Thus this Unit has been designed to allow a necessary introduction, an
initial study into two areas within power supply circuits and practical design and build of two
types of power supply.
Outcome 1 introduces the concept of converting alternating current/voltage to direct
current/voltage and the means of improving the quality of the output. You will perform
calculations to allow you to select correct components.
Outcome 2 builds on this by considering how to maintain specified output values given that
input and output conditions will fluctuate. You will perform calculations to reinforce this. It
also introduces the concept of controlling the output values by using feedback to regulate the
supply to the output and the three terminal regulator power supply. Finally it introduces means
of protecting the supplied circuit and the power supply circuit.
Outcome 3 introduces a different area of power supply circuits, namely Switched Mode Power
Supplies, or SMPS. There are many different variations of SMPS, here you will learn about the
method of converting input to output through a high frequency switching circuit which is
common to the majority. You will perform calculations which link switching frequency to
output voltage levels.
Outcome 4 provides an opportunity to design, select components, construct and test a three
terminal regulator power supply and a SMPS. The exact circuits which you will perform
calculations for in all Outcomes is at the discretion of the particular centre where you are
studying. In addition you may have access to simulation software which will allow you to test
some or all of your calculations and/or designs. The emphasis of this Unit is practical and it is
worth noting that practical working circuits are to be produced.
Outcomes 1 to 3 will be assessed by one closed book assessment, done under controlled and
supervised conditions, lasting one hour and thirty minutes. Outcome 4 is a practical assignment.
You are to carry out all work in a timely fashion and on an individual basis. You will pass
Outcome 4 if you successfully design, select components, construct, test and maintain a log
book.
Successful achievement of this Unit will provide underpinning knowledge for further Units
which make use of power supplies whether in theory or practice. You may choose to do as
many have done and make power supplies your career.SQA Advanced Unit Specification

Unit specification: support notes
Unit title: Sequential Logic
This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not
mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
design length is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
Candidates should be made aware during the unit introduction of the wide application for
sequential logic techniques in society today. Sequential logic is found in the Personal Computer
and associated peripheral devices, mobile phone technology, MP3 Players, Mini Discs, satellite
communication and is the major technology behind the Internet. Sequential logic can be found
to be controlling and directing information in routers, switches and hubs. It should be
emphasised that although the subject of sequential logic is a specialist area it is based on well-
understood combinational logic and as such candidates have already been studying sequential
logic techniques in earlier courses such as NQ and SQA Advanced Units Combinational Logic.
Outcome 1: The general block diagram of a sequential circuit introduced in Outcome 1 can be
used to clarify the connection between the candidates existing knowledge and the new
sequential techniques to be learned in this Unit. All of the knowledge and techniques learned
to design combinational logic circuits - logic expressions, truth tables and Karnaugh mapping
techniques will be used throughout this Unit. The Sequential circuit Model described by the
general block diagram should also be used throughout the Unit to place the circuits being
discussed in context. Gates, Truth Tables and combinational logic techniques being used to
design the Combinational Logic Network whereas Bistables, Action Tables and knowledge of
specific sequential logic techniques are used to design the Sequential Logic Network. After
studying Outcome 1 the candidate should be able to:
• Describe the difference between combinational and sequential circuits
• Draw and label the General block diagram of sequential machine
• Describe the difference between asynchronous and synchronous operations
Outcome 2: The cross-coupled gates forming the latch of Outcome 2 can again be viewed and
compared against the Sequential Logic General Block Diagram. The use of the SR Latch for
switch contact de-bounce could be used as a common practical application of this
configuration. Some time should be spent familiarising candidates with the modes of operation
of the SR latch and other bistables, before moving on to clocked bistables it should be
emphasised that the operating modes are the same — it is just when the device is active that is
different - depending on the state of asynchronous inputs and the low, rising, high and falling
states of the synchronous clock input. Sufficient time should be given to practical activities in
this Outcome to allow candidates to further develop their construction skills and device
understanding before moving on to formative assessment.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP3Y 47: Sequential Logic 9
After studying Outcome 2 the candidate should be able to:
Relating to an SR Latch
• Draw a Latch based on Cross Coupled gates
• Compare Latch to Sequential Model
• Draw Action Table
• State the effect of SR inputs on the Q output
Relating to a specified Clocked Bistables
• Draw the Circuit symbol
• Draw the Action Table
• Identify the sensitive phase of the clock
• Describe the function of Synchronous inputs
• Describe the function of Asynchronous inputs
• Interpret Waveform Timing Diagrams
Outcome 3: In Outcome 3 the ripple counter is used as an example of an asynchronous
sequential logic circuit. This provides an opportunity to discuss the accumulative propagation
delay limitations of multi-stage ripple counters and reset noise. The Unit is not intended to
cover the asynchronous design process in detail, the main emphasis is in the design of bistable
based synchronous sequential circuits using appropriate techniques such as the state transition
diagram, state transition table and the use of Karnaugh maps for simplification of next state
logic equations. Other design techniques can be used in a similar consistent manner. The end
product should be correct logic circuit diagrams detailed in the knowledge and/or skills
evidence requirement sections.
After studying Outcome 3 the candidate should be able to:
• Produce a design based on bistables for a Sequence Generator or Sequence Detector
from specified bit pattern
• Draw a block diagram for a specified shift register configuration and describe an element
of its operation.
Outcome 4: Outcome 4 concentrates on simulation, build and testing of devices, synchronous
counters, sequence generators and detectors specified in Outcomes 2 and 3. As there are no
MSI devices used early versions of Electronics Workbench found in most colleges and
provided free through software schemes should be adequate to simulate all designs, other low
cost simulation programmes should be sufficient. Logic tutors should be used throughout to
implement the circuits both formatively and summatively, candidates should be encouraged to
develop techniques to keep track of wiring during construction and organise the testing of
circuits by drawing up test tables to record circuit operation. Candidates should also be allowed
to develop their testing and fault finding skills further using state transition diagrams to track
the operation of completed designs and encouraged to correct any circuit faults encountered.
After studying Outcome 4 the candidate should be able to:
• Build and Test Clocked Bistables from Outcome 2
• Simulate Sequence Generator or Sequence Detector designed in Outcome 3
• Build and Test Sequence Generator or Sequence Detector designed in Outcome 3
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP3Y 47: Sequential Logic 10
Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
Timing of this Unit would normally be in the first year of an SQA Advanced Certificate/
Diploma immediately after completion of the SQA Advanced Unit Combinational Logic. On
completion of Sequential logic candidates can progress on to the SQA Advanced Unit
Programmable Logic Devices or MSI Devices this progression fits in with a 2 semesters or 3-
term first and second year SQA Advanced Diploma.
Assessment for Outcomes 3 and 4 should follow the recognised order of design, simulate build
and test. A holistic approach should be adopted to emphasise the recursive nature of the design
– simulate – build – test cycle.
The instruments of assessment for Outcome 1 should be restricted to a written/graphical
exercise. A written graphical exercise testing the Knowledge element should also be used for
Outcome 2; assignment exercises and computer simulation packages providing candidates with
practical experience of using bistables will help understanding and knowledge retention.
Assessment for Outcome 3 has two elements, the first takes the form of a short answer/
graphical test covering the operation of and block diagrams for listed shift registers carried out
under closed book examination conditions. The second element is a design exercise, this should
be done under controlled conditions with access only to relevant data sheets provided. Again
practical assignment exercises and computer simulation packages can be used to develop and
enhance candidate understanding of the knowledge and/or skills elements, the design exercise
for Outcome 3 will be simulated, built and tested as the assessment for Outcome 4.
It is recommended that Outcomes 1 and 2 and the shift register operation/block diagram
element of Outcome 3 be assessed using a single paper of 1 hour duration at the end of the
Unit.
The design element of Outcome 3 should be carried out under closed book examination
conditions with access to appropriate data sheets, the design should be completed within 1
hour.
The assessment for Outcome 4 should be carried out in a less formal and relaxed setting to
encourage candidates to experiment and share ideas, however care should be taken to ensure
that evidence is candidates own work and observational checklists should be used to record
candidates progress through practical assignments and simulation exercises where they
contribute towards summative assessment for Outcome 4.
The complete design, simulate, build and test assessment should take a total of three hours.
Open learning
This Unit could be delivered by distance learning or flexibly, however the centre would have
to provide access to a logic tutor and suitable software to support the considerable amount of
practical activity required for developing the skills to meet the assessment requirements of
Outcome 4. Centres would also take steps to ensure that their quality assurance systems can be
extended to cover the open learning mode of delivery.

Much of the developments seen today in modern technology are down to the techniques you
will study in this Unit - computers, internet technology - switches hubs and routers, CD and
DVD technology, Mini Disks, MP3 players, Electronic Musical Instruments, MIDI, MP3
players, mobile phones, satellite communications, CAD/CAM systems: the list goes on and on.
This Unit has been designed to provide you with the knowledge and skills that will enable you

Logic Circuits are organised, how they are different from Combinational Logic Circuits and
also how they are constructed using a mixture of gates and bistables.
When you studied Combinational logic you learned about the basic building block of a
combinational logic circuit - the gate; in this Unit you will learn about the basic building block
of a Sequential Logic circuit - the Bistable.

Unit title: MCU/MPU Assembly Language Programming
This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not
mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
design length is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
This Unit has been written in order to allow candidates to develop the knowledge,
understanding and skills in the following areas:
1. Describe the operation of an assembly language program in a microcontroller or
microprocessor based system.
2. Generate software to read data, process it and output the correct result.
3. Generate software that exercises various program branching structures while
accessing external devices.
4. Generate software that utilises sub programs in the control of external devices.
This Unit was designed to permit candidates to apply assembly language to the control of
input/output hardware, and develop skill in the utilisation of an appropriate program
development environment. It is intended that candidates will be given example programs to
assist in the development of their ability to understand Microcontroller/Microprocessor
operation. To access external hardware, set-up and read/write ports candidates should be
supplied with program modules such as macros or subroutines. The external devices could
include, but not be limited to, switch/LED Units, stepper motors, A to D and D to A converters.
This Unit does not include specifications for the type of target system - this is left up to the
discretion of centres. It is appreciated that centres will have access to a wide variety of
hardware, such as personal computers, microprocessor development boards, microcontrollers,
and DSP devices, all of which may be utilised to support this Unit. Centres should endeavour
to utilise current technology in delivering this Unit.
Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit was developed as one of a series of SQA Advanced programming Units and is at
SCQF level 7. The Unit is designed to be taken as a stand-alone Unit or integrated with the
Unit MCU/MPU I/O Hardware Control at SCQF level 8.
This Unit should be taught using a student centred approach. In designing this Unit it was
envisaged that candidates would learn by doing rather that in a classroom context. The
provision of subroutines or macros to provide access to external hardware is intended to permit
the student to concentrate on program operation and structures via programs that will interact
with the external world.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP42 47: MCU/MPU Assembly Language Programming 9
Outcome 1 depth and coverage should be sufficient to underpin the candidates’ understanding
of the software development expected in Outcomes 2, 3 and 4. A suggested approach might be
to introduce elements of the hardware and architecture as they become necessary during the
development of the candidates’ assembly language skills. For example, when explaining how
a simple program runs, a simplified explanation of the fetch-execute cycle could be developed
with reference to the microprocessor program counter, instruction register, address and data
registers, control signals and random access memory. Similarly when introducing the
candidates’ to branching programs the function of the condition code register could be
introduced and explained.
A list of topics by Outcome is given below with approximate timings and advice on coverage.
The timings are to be seen as a guide to how much weight to place in each area. They are not
prescriptive.
Outcome 1
Describe the operation of an assembly language program in a microcontroller or
microprocessor based system.
It is difficult to specify a time allocation here since it is anticipated that the fetch/execute cycle
description, instruction format and hexadecimal notation will be incorporated into the teaching
and practical examples used for Outcomes 2, 3 and 4. The idea of CPU, ROM, RAM, I/O and
memory map should feature in discussions. As a rough guide spend no more than a 2 or 3 hours
spread through the Unit time allocation.
Outcome 2
Generate software to read data, process it and output the correct result. (8hours)
• cover data move, add, subtract, multiply and divide instructions. Bring in a reference to
the effect that these have on the Condition Code Register (CCR).
• while these rather simple programs are being exercised the students should be given the
opportunity to gain familiarity with the editing/programming/debug environment. Many
simple examples can be demonstrated within a debugging environment which show very
clearly the program flow and effects on registers, memory and CCR.
• as the student’s experience grows access to I/O ports can be introduced with examples of
the use of (supplied) subroutines to set up and access external ports
Outcome 3
Generate software that exercises various program branching structures while accessing
external devices (10 hours)
• Demonstrate using the debug tools the flow of a program that has an unconditional
branch. Follow this with a simple conditional branch and show the branch being taken
and NOT taken depending on the state of the corresponding CCR flag.
• Illustrate the following structures:
— If/Then, If/Then/Else, While/Do, Repeat/Until, For/Next
Outcome 4
Generate software that utilises sub programs in the control of external devices (12 hrs)
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HP42 47: MCU/MPU Assembly Language Programming 10
• use the debug tool to illustrate what happens when a subroutine call is made and a
subsequent Return from Subroutine. Introduce and show the operation of the Stack for
storing return addresses.
• some microprocessors and microcontrollers have separate Jump and Branch to
Subroutine instructions. Illustrate both of these to show the difference.
Most of the student learning should be through practical tutorials following demonstrations.
Students should be encouraged to modify existing programs rather than starting from scratch.
The tutorial exercises could be developed in the context of an overarching final assessment or
smaller assignments which still yield evidence to support the candidates’ competence as
described in each Outcome.
The extra 8 hours not accounted for above can be counted as home study and preparation for
laboratory exercises.
Open learning
This Unit is more suitable for laboratory delivery however it could be delivered by distance
learning provided the candidate has access to a microprocessor development system and
external hardware interfaces. This may require some degree of on-line support. However, with
regard to assessment, planning would be required by the centre concerned to ensure the
sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence. Arrangements could be required to be put
in place to ensure that the assessment whether done at a single or at multiple events was
conducted under controlled, supervised conditions.
To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that a single assessment
paper (taken by candidates at a single assessment event) be used for distance learning
candidates.
For information on normal open learning arrangements, please refer to the SQA guide
Assessment and Quality Assurance of Open and Distance Learning (SQA 2000)
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative
evidence.

General information for candidates
Unit title: Assembly Language Programming
This Unit is intended to introduce the candidate to embedded systems software design. There
are many devices in current use which utilise devices which contain a microprocessor, read-
only and random access memory, EEprom memory, various peripheral interfaces all contained
inside a single integrated circuit. These devices are called Microcontrollers. Common examples
include car engine management, airbag systems, printers and mobile phones. They are usually
programmed in C and/or Assembly language.
This Unit will introduce you to assembly language programs to read, process and output data
to effect control of external hardware. This will give you the necessary knowledge and skills
to apply assembly language programming expertise to engineering solutions which utilise
embedded systems. You will also gain experience in the use of a software development
environment the complexity of which will depend on the resources available to the centre.
You will have the opportunity to develop input/output programs and test them with suitable
external hardware in the laboratory. Each part of the Unit will be introduced by experiment,
after which there will be an assessed practical exercise. These will be assessed mostly by
laboratory reports. The lecturer will also be completing checklists to ensure that you have
completed all necessary parts of the exercises. You may also be required to submit to a brief
oral examination to ensure that the work you have submitted is your own and that you fully
understand the material.
The centre where you are studying may choose to combine parts of this Unit with the level 8
SQA Advanced Unit MCU/MCP I/O Hardware Control. This will have the benefit of reducing
the amount of assessment you have to undertake. It will be the responsibility of the centre to
ensure that all parts of the syllabus are still covered.SQA Advanced Unit Specification

Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
This Unit has been written in order to allow candidates to develop their knowledge,
understanding and skills in the following areas:
• investigate the operation and characteristics of a range of discrete semiconductor
devices
• investigate and demonstrate applications of semiconductor diodes
• investigate and demonstrate transistors applications
• investigate and demonstrate linear operational amplifiers characteristics and
applications
This Unit has been developed as a stand-alone topic in Analogue Electronics within the
mandatory section of the new SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma in Electronics Awards.
This is a double credit Unit at SCQF level 7(16 SCQF credit points at SCQF level 7).
In designing this Unit, a range of topics have been identified which lecturers are expected to
cover. Recommendations have also been given as to how much time should be spent on
each Outcome. This has been done to help lecturers to decide what depth of treatment
should be given to the topics attached to each of the Outcomes. Whilst it is not mandatory
for centres to use this list of topics it is strongly recommended that they do so to ensure
continuity of teaching and learning, and because the assessment exemplar pack for this Unit
is based on the Knowledge and/or Skills and list of topics in each of the Outcomes.
One practical exercise will only be assessed for each Outcome but candidates are expected
to carry out eight practical and simulation exercises on a wide range of circuits.
A list of topics is given below. The suggested times exclude assessment.

Online and Distance Learning
This Unit could be delivered by distance learning, which may incorporate some degree of on-
line support. However, with regards to assessment, planning would be required by the centre
concerned to ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence. Arrangements
would be required to be put in place to ensure that assessment, whether done at a single or
multiple events, was conducted under controlled, supervised conditions.
Arrangements would have to be made for the candidates to do the two practical
assessments at the centre.
To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that a single
assessment paper taken by candidates at a single assessment event be used for distance
learning candidates.
For information on normal open learning arrangements, please refer to the SQA guide
Assessment and Quality Assurance of Open and Distance Learning (SQA 2000).
Opportunities for developing Core Skills
Although there is no automatic certification of core skills in this unit, there may be
opportunities to develop the core skills of Numeracy and Problem Solving.
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers
to learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account
when planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering
alternative evidence.
Further advice can be found on our website www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.

This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not
mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
design length is 180 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
The content will be the knowledge, skills and attributes a candidate has developed in the
context of employment (for at least a year) of a bona fide employer. The skills, etc will
normally be laid out in the national occupational standards (at SVQ level 3) for the
candidate’s occupational role. These are developed for the whole of the United Kingdom by
Sector Skills Councils (SSCs). Appendix 1 gives an example of an information sheet setting
out the broad requirements of an occupational role at SVQ level 3. More information on
SSCs can be found at http://www.skillsdevelopmentscotland.co.uk/. Candidates should
broadly comply with the overall aims of Units which apply to their role. Only if they wish to
progress to achieve a full SVQ (or an SVQ Unit) would they need to comply with the detail
of the national occupational standards.
Appendix 2 gives the level descriptions for SCQF level 7.
Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This should be delivered using the normal annual appraisal methods of the industry
concerned. A candidate and tutor guide has been produced, summarising these methods. This
will be useful for candidates employed in organisations without a formal system.
Open learning
Self- appraisal and employer comment may be done at a distance (by letter, email, etc) and
the candidate/tutor interview conducted by video conferencing. Alternatively, the approved
centre may inspect the performance appraisal system used in the candidate’s workplace and
accept its outcome. So long as the approved centre can assure the authenticity of the claims
and appraisals, face-to-face contact with the candidate need not always be required.
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative
evidence.

General information for candidates
Unit title: Work Role Effectiveness (2003)
To give SQA Credits to those currently or recently in employment, who were effective in an
occupational role similar to that defined by the national occupational standards used in
Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs) at level 3 and where that role has been executed at
levels of autonomy described at SCQF level 7.
The assessment approach will be based on performance-appraisal systems common in
employment. Self-appraisal against a role profile (including SVQ Unit titles and outlines)
will be combined with employer appraisal (or references), both of which will be moderated in
a professional interview conducted by an assessor at an SQA Advanced centre approved to
offer this Unit. The candidates will also begin to identify their own developmental or training
needs.
On completion of the Unit the candidate should: be acquainted with performance appraisal
approaches; be familiar with the outline of an occupational role defined by an SVQ at level 3;
confirm relevant achievements at work as being comparable to those outlined in the national
occupational standards used.
Following successful completion of the Unit, candidates will be able to:
• use the SQA Credit as part of an SQA Advanced Certificate or SQA Advanced Diploma.
• use the SQA Advanced Certificate or SQA Advanced Diploma as credit towards a degree
or professional qualification.
• gather more detailed evidence of their achievements to match the requirements of SVQ
Units used in the role profile.
• otherwise seek to satisfy the developmental or training needs identified.

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this unit
This unit may be taught as a freestanding unit, however it also could be combined with appropriate
unit(s) to allow integration of related topics.
The unit is designed to introduce the candidate to switchgear and protection for the electricity supply
system and then to provide greater knowledge in the listed topics. These topics are pertinent for those
working with the supply system or industrial installations, thus the unit should appeal to a wide range
of candidates within Electrical Engineering disciplines.
Delivery of Outcome 1 should be such as to equip the candidate with knowledge of the rational for
implementing a protection scheme and some fundamental components of such a scheme. It could be
taught in conjunction with Outcome 3 to allow the links between protection schemes and switchgear
devices to be made as well as to introduce the assignment at an early stage within the teaching of the
unit.
Delivery of Outcome 2 should focus on protection schemes utilised on standard distribution
(Primary) substation feeders. This will include development of skills required to calculate IDMT
settings for one such scheme.
Delivery of Outcome 4 should focus on all the protection schemes listed in the knowledge and/or
skills section.
Assessment of this unit falls into two areas. One written assessment towards the end of the unit under
controlled, supervised conditions and one assignment. It is recommended that the assignment is
issued to the candidate at an early stage in the delivery of the unit. Details on approaches to
assessment are given under evidence requirements and assessment guidelines in the SQA Advanced
unit specification: statement of standards section. It is recommended that these sections be read
carefully before proceeding with assessment of candidates.
Where possible an industrial visit should be carried out and linked to the assignment. If such is not
possible other supplementary information should be used to support delivery (eg guest speakers,
video clips). In addition, a degree of variety should be incorporated into the assignment to allow the
candidates to work on individual scenarios as well as helping to avoid plagiarism. However, it is
recognised that it may be inefficient to provide each candidate with a unique assignment when a large
class is being taught.
Open learning
This unit could be delivered on an open learning basis. The centre would have to ensure that the
written assessment was carried out under controlled and supervised conditions. In addition the
authenticity of assignment carried out, out with the centre, would need to be proved.
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to learning
or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when planning learning
experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative evidence.

General information for candidates
Unit title: Switchgear and Protection of High Voltage Systems
The aim of this unit is to cover two vital components of any electricity system; switchgear and
protection. The consequences of either of these failing can be widespread and long lasting. As a
direct result from this it is expected that any fault detected on an electricity supply system should be
removed as rapidly as possible and with the minimum of disruption. Protection schemes and
associated switchgear are the means by which such is made possible.
Many industrial sites have voltage distribution networks, running at voltages above low voltage, that
incorporate protection schemes, thus study of this unit is pertinent to both those in electricity supply
industry as well as other industries. In addition, study of this unit is pertinent to those who are
interested in renewable energy and who wish to learn more about the connection of small scale
generators to the electricity supply network.
The unit is divided into four outcomes. In Outcome 1 you will be introduced to the fundamentals of a
protection scheme and relevant components that are required to accurately represent voltage and
current at lower magnitudes. Outcome 2 is a detailed study of common protection found on substation
feeders and will probably centre round a 33/11 kV substation. In particular you will study, in some
depth, the implementation of a protection scheme that utilises inverse definite minimum time (IDMT)
relays and discrimination. Note that you are not expected to be familiar with these terms prior to
starting this unit. Outcome 3 covers the construction, operation and application of switchgear. For the
purposes of this unit, switchgear covers: circuit breakers, switches, isolators and fuses. Lastly,
Outcome 4 is a study of the operation and application of particular protection schemes with in the
electricity supply system.
Assessment is at the discretion of the centre at which you are studying. However, it is envisaged that
you will have two opportunities to prove your knowledge and abilities. Firstly your tutor should
provide you with an assignment during your study of this unit and secondly, you will be required to
sit a closed book assessment, which will be carried out under controlled and supervised conditions
and will last two hours. The assignment will cover Outcomes 3 and 4 and the assessment Outcomes 1
and 2. You are to carry out all work in a timely fashion and on an individual basis.
Successful achievement of this unit will provide underpinning knowledge fSQA Advanced Unit (HV4W 48): Synchronous Machines 1

General information for candidates
Unit title: Transformers
A transformer is a device used for transforming an AC voltage of one level into a voltage of another
level with minimum power loss. Worldwide, transformers are used extensively in electricity supply
systems, and many industrial consumers have voltage distribution networks running at high voltages
that incorporate transformers. This unit has been designed to enable you to develop the knowledge
and skills that will allow you to understand the theory and principles of these transformers.
You will begin by learning about the materials and designs used in the construction of transformers.
You will then progress to study the operation of transformers. You will learn how to calculate
quantities such as efficiency and voltage regulation. Both single-phase and three-phase transformers
will be covered in this unit. You will learn about the different winding configurations used in
transformers, and the conditions required to be satisfied before individual transformers can safely be
paralleled together. The operation and application of transformer fittings such as cooling systems and
tap changers will be investigated, and the methods of protecting transformers against fault damage
will be explained.
In summary, by the end of this unit you should be able to: explain the construction characteristics of
transformers; analyse the operation of single-phase transformers on load; analyse the operation of
three phase transformers; and explain transformer protection.
The formal assessment for the unit will take two forms: a laboratory exercise (or case study) and a
written, two-hour assessment paper. The laboratory exercise or case study will take place during the
delivery of the unit. The written assessment paper will be carried out at the end of the delivery of the
unit, and it will be conducted under closed-book conditions. This means that you will not be allowed
to take notes, textbooks etc. into the assessment. You will be allowed to use a scientific calculator.SQA Advanced Unit (HV4Y 48): Utilisation of Electrical Energy in Buildings 1

Outcome 4
• Explain the requirement for proportional, integral and derivative (PID) control
State that the main advantage of PID control is that system response can be tailored to meet a
particular control specification.
• Explain the effect of each term of a three term controller on closed-loop behaviour
State the effect each mode of a PID controller has on system characteristics and compare with
simulated responses.
• Describe circuits realising three term control
Draw an operational amplifier based circuit diagram, with calculated component values, to
realise PID controller settings.
• Use simulation software to determine controller settings
Use an appropriate PID tuning method (for example Ziegler and Nichols) to initially tune the
controller and then fine tune to meet a given specification.
Assessment guidelines for Outcomes 2 to 4
It is recommended that Outcome 2, Outcome 3 and Outcome 4 of this unit be combined together into
one assignment to be carried out at the end of the unit delivery.
It is suggested that the assignment could commence with the candidate being given a fourth order
transfer function of a plant under proportional control. The candidate would be expected, through the
use of a control simulation software package such as Codas, to predict its closed-loop behaviour from
the analysis of its frequency response. Software analysis and calculation should allow the candidate
to determine transient and steady-state values from which a second order approximation of the system
can be determined. This second order response is compared with the higher order response.
PID control can then be applied to the plant to meet a given control specification. Candidates should
draw the circuit diagram, with calculated component values, to realise the PID controller.
Candidates should submit a report containing a hard copy of the appropriate files created during the
use of the simulation package. The candidate should answer all questions and tasks set in the
assignment.
Use of the software package to simulate and produce graphs etc should be conducted under
supervised open-book conditions and it is suggested that it should be completed within three hours.
The assessor should observe the candidates to ensure that they are individually able to use the
simulation package.
Analysis of simulation printouts, answering set questions covering the describe-and-explain elements,
and report writing can be conducted open-book outside the centre in their own study time.

Unit title: Control Systems Behaviour
This part of the unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not mandatory.
While the exact time allocated to this unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional design length
is 40 hours.
Guidance on the content and context for this unit
This unit has been written in order to allow candidates to develop knowledge, understanding and
skills in the following areas:
1 modelling of systems under closed-loop control
2 prediction of transient and steady-state behaviour of closed-loop control
3 analysis of control systems using frequency response methods
4 proportional, integral and derivative (PID) control
This unit is at SCQF level 8 and has been devised as an optional unit within the new SQA Advanced
Diploma in Electrical Engineering. However it does not preclude the use of this unit in other awards
where award designers feel this to be appropriate.
In designing this unit, the writer has identified the range of topics expected to be covered by
lecturers. The writer has also given recommendations as to how much time should be spent on each
outcome. This has been done to allow lecturers to decide what depth of treatment should be given to
the topics attached to each of the outcomes.
A list of topics for each outcome is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list so that they
can get a clear indication of the standard of achievement expected of candidates in this unit.
1 Demonstrate the modelling of closed-loop systems (5 hours).
The candidate should be made aware how a first order transfer function for a system component
can be determined eg DC motor, potentiometer, tachogenerator etc.
This should be used to represent a given control system in block diagram form from a given
schematic diagram. Systems such as a remote position control, motor speed control and the
temperature control of an oven can be used. The forward path transfer function G(s) and the
feedback path transfer function H(s) of the system can then be determined and used to calculate
the closed-loop transfer function of the system using:)()(1

This is the DC value of the overall system gain, whether
open-loop or closed-loop. It is a function of the individual
gains, whether within the loop or outwith. The individual
gains within a closed-loop system can affect the closed-loop
transient behaviour ( and ).
ξ damping factor
We can extract the damping factor ξ, the natural frequency of oscillation ωn and the DC gain
KDC. Using the following set equations, these parameters can be used to calculate the remaining
characteristics and allow one to sketch the closed-loop system response.)1( 2

For a Second Order System, the settling time tells us the time for the transient to die away to
within some tolerance band. For an underdamped system this transient response takes the form
of an exponential envelope. The response must not only reach but also stay within the band. A
typical tolerance band would be +0.5% to –0.5% of the steady-state value, this approximates to 5
time constants as with first order systems.
This calculated response can be verified using a computer simulation package.

3 Apply frequency response methods to the analysis of control systems (10 hours)
Various open-loop frequency response methods can be used to predict how a system will behave
under closed-loop control. This can be used to prevent possible system damage, due to excessive
overshoot for example, when the closed-loop control is applied. A convenient way of predicting
closed-loop behaviour without actually having to connect the feedback path is to obtain the
open-loop frequency response of the system (either by calculation or measurement) and then
presenting the information graphically. Nichols frequency response method is recommended as
it is the most informative and user friendly. We can make use of a computer simulation package
to produce a Nichols plot from which the gain and phase margins can be measured. Examination
of the gain and phase margins allows one to determine whether a system will be stable or not,
absolute stability. It also can give an indication just how stable a system is, relative stability ie if
the gain margin is between 8 and 12 dBs AND the phase margin is between 45 and 50 degrees.
Using gain and phase margins as measures of relative stability gives an idea of the type of
response, but it is not possible to use open-loop data to quantify closed-loop behaviour. What we
need is closed-loop frequency response data. In the time domain, the step responses of
underdamped second order systems exhibit an overshoot when the damping ratio is less than
unity. In the frequency domain there is an analogous situation where the system exhibits
resonance for damping ratios less than 1/2 where the gain reaches a peak value, Mp, greater
than unity. The peak gain is referred to as the peak magnification factor, hence the use of the
letter M. For design purposes, one requires loci of constant closed-loop gain which are termed
M-contours. These loci are curves superimposed on the open-loop plot, on which the closed-loop
magnification factor is constant. A good measure of the damped natural frequency of the closed-
loop system is its resonant frequency, ωr. This frequency can be found by locating the frequency
at which the open-loop frequency response locus is tangential to the smallest M-contour.
The simulation package can also allow the Mp and the resonant angular frequency ωr to be
determined from examination of the Nichols or Bode Gain plots. These parameters allow the
system damping factor ξ and natural frequency of oscillation ωn to be calculated using the
following formulae:)1(2

4 Apply three term controllers to closed-loop control systems (10 hours)
A three term controller can be used to meet most control specifications. The three modes of
control PID, proportional integral and derivative, are applied to the error signal from the error
detector. Each mode of the PID controller can be adjusted independently by altering the gain,
integral action time and derivative action time settings respectively. Software simulation can be
used to find the controller settings for each mode in order to meet the control specification. A
systems closed-loop response can be made acceptable by tuning a two or three term controller.
However, attempting to tune the controller purely by trial and error can be tedious and
sometimes misleading. Systematic tuning methods such as Ziegler and Nichols may be
employed. The Ziegler and Nichols method is adopted to initially roughly tune the controller
settings after which fine adjustments can be made to meet a given control specification.
Operational amplifier, integrator and derivative circuits can be used to realise each mode of the
controller with component values calculated from the controller setting of gain, integral and
derivative action times.

General information for candidates
Unit title: Control Systems Behaviour
This unit has been designed to allow you to develop knowledge, understanding and skills associated
with control systems.
Outcomes 1 and 2 of the unit will introduce you to control systems modelling which allows the
control engineer to predict the closed-loop behaviour of a control system from calculations.
Outcome 3 of the unit will provide you with the opportunity to use a simulation software package to
predict the closed-loop behaviour from the analysis of the open-loop frequency response.
Outcome 4 will introduce you to proportional, integral and derivative (PID) control, sometimes
referred to three term control. This will allow you to tailor the response of a system to meet a
particular control design specification.
The assessment for Outcome 1 will consist of a one hour written paper to be carried out under
supervised, closed-book conditions. Candidates will be issued a formula sheet containing component
transfer functions that can be used in the assessment. This assessment paper will be presented to you
at the end of delivery for Outcome 1.
The assessment for Outcome 2, Outcome 3 and Outcome 4 of this unit is combined together into one
assignment. This assignment will be issued towards the end of the unit after all relevant theory,
concepts and practice using simulation software, has been completed. This assignment will consist of
a number of tasks that all have to be completed. The assignment tasks will be generally divided up
into two areas, use of the simulation software and analysis of results. The simulation content of the
assignment will be conducted under supervised open-book conditions and should be completed
within six hours. Analysis of results, required calculations and report preparation can take place
outside the centre. You may be given a third or higher order transfer function of a plant from which
you are expected to predict its closed-loop behaviour, under proportional control. This can be
achieved from the analysis of its frequency response. Software analysis should allow you to
determine transient and steady-state values from which a second order approximation of the system
can be determined and compared with the higher order response. Using the software package you will
then be required to apply PID control to the plant to meet a given control specification. You will then
be expected to draw the circuit diagram, with calculated component values, to realise the PID
controller. You are expected to submit a report containing a hard copy of the appropriate files created
during the use of the simulation package. The candidate should answer all questions and carry out all
tasks set in the assignment.SQA Advanced Unit (HV53 48): Electrical Standby Systems 1

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this unit
The subjects of standby generators and UPS are both large and lecturers need to be realistic about
what it is possible to deliver in the time available. Lecturers should select examples of standby
generators and UPS which are typically used in modern industrial or commercial applications.
Centres delivering this unit are strongly encouraged to allow candidates to view as many practical
battery, generator and UPS systems as possible. This may be achieved through the presence of such
systems in the centre or by visits to appropriate industrial or commercial premises. Good charts and
other visual aids showing complete and disassembled parts of battery, generator and UPS systems
will also be a good aid to candidate learning. The internet provides a rich source of information on
batteries, standby/emergency generators and UPS, and candidates should be actively encouraged to
explore sites which contain helpful information. Likewise manufacturers’ catalogues and data sheets
also contain useful sources of information particularly with regard to the performance characteristics
of batteries, generators and UPS.
Information on evidence requirements and assessment guidelines is given after Outcome 3 in the
SQA Advanced Unit specification: statement of standards section. The written assessment paper
should take place after Outcomes 1 to 3 have been completed.
Open learning
This unit could be delivered by distance learning, which may incorporate some degree of online
support. However, with regards to assessment, planning would be required by the centre concerned to
ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence.
Arrangements would be required to be put in place to ensure that assessment, whether done at a
single or multiple events, was conducted under controlled, supervised conditions.
To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that for distance learning
candidates the assessment paper is taken at a single assessment event.
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to learning
or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when planning learning
experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative evidence.

SQA Advanced Unit (HV53 48): Electrical Standby Systems 10
General information for candidates
Unit title: Electrical Standby Systems
Standby, or back-up, systems are very important in Electrical Engineering as they ensure the
maintenance of electrical energy when other power systems fail.
In this unit you will examine three types of back-up systems: namely batteries, generators and UPS
(uninterruptible power supplies). Batteries come in many shapes and sizes and different battery types
are more suitable for particular applications. In this unit you will learn about the construction and
principles of operation of basic batteries and the characteristics and applications of a range of
different battery types.
The subject of standby generators is very large and it would be impossible to teach you all about
them in one unit. In this unit you will learn about the construction and principle of operation of
different types of standby generator, how generators are driven, the key performance characteristics
of generators, and other technical requirements relating to generator operation including control,
electrical protection, installation, safety and maintenance.
UPS (uninterruptible power supplies) are used widely in industry and commerce. In this unit you will
learn about the basic function of this type of power supply. How they are constructed and operate,
what their key performance characteristics are, how to ‘size’ them to supply different types of
equipment and how software can be used to control some of their operations.
There are plenty of good learning materials available both in paper format and via the internet on
batteries, standby generators and UPS. Your lecturer is likely to strongly encourage you to explore
manufacturers’ catalogues, datasheets and investigate internet sites to find out more about batteries,
generators and UPS.
Assessment for this unit will comprise of a two-hour written test following the delivery of
Outcomes 1 to 3.1

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit has been designed as an optional Unit for candidates on the SQA Advanced Diploma in
Electrical Engineering. The Unit should provide SQA Advanced Diploma candidates with
knowledge, understanding and skills about analogue electronic components and circuits. The Unit
should provide them with the underpinning knowledge that will allow them to further their studies in
analogue electronics and related subjects such as Power Electronics.
This Unit has been designed to incorporate sufficient time to allow lecturers to teach all the analogue
electronic principles contained in the Unit. There is also sufficient time for candidates to practice
what they have learnt through appropriate formative written exercises and practical laboratory work.
Where possible, students should construct circuits on breadboard when they are carrying out practical
exercises for Outcome 3. Circuit simulation, using suitable software packages, should be undertaken
but is not part of the assessment procedure. Some of the practical work will be assessed as stated
under Evidence requirements and Assessment guidelines for Outcome 3 in the SQA Advanced
Diploma Unit specification: statement of standards section. Circuits constructed during the practical
activities for the Unit could be used for the practical assessment.
It is recommended that the written assessment takes place after completion of Outcomes 1 and 2. The
practical assessment should take place after completion of Outcome 3.

SQA Advanced Unit (HT7J 46): Analogue Electronics: An Introduction 10
Open learning
This Unit could be delivered by distance learning, which may incorporate some degree of online
support. However, with regards to assessment, planning would be required by the centre concerned to
ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence. Arrangements would be required to be
put in place to ensure that assessment, whether done at a single or multiple events, was conducted
under controlled, supervised conditions.
To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that a single assessment paper
taken by candidates at a single assessment event be used for distance learning candidates.
For information on normal open learning arrangements, please refer to the SQA guide Assessment
and Quality Assurance of Open and Distance Learning (SQA 2000)

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit is a suitable introduction to digital electronic systems. The Unit has been designed to allow
candidates sufficient time to carry out a range of practical experimentation, circuit construction and
verification exercises to supplement their learning. Tutors should make available experimental
exercises which will allow candidates, where possible, to work on their own. Candidates should have
free access to manufacturer’s data sheets for the devices used.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
SQA Advanced Unit (HT7L 47): Digital Electronics 9
Computer simulation could form part of the teaching and learning process such as the verification of
Boolean identities and Karnaugh mapping.
Details on approaches to assessment are given under Evidence Requirements and Assessment
guidelines under each Outcome in the SQA Advanced Unit specification: statement of standards
section. It is recommended that these sections be read carefully before proceeding with assessment of
candidates.
Open learning
This Unit could be delivered by distance learning, which may incorporate some degree of on-line
support. Candidates will also require access to a centre which, can provide circuit construction
facilities. With regard to assessment, planning would be required by the centre concerned to ensure
the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence. Arrangements would be required to ensure
that the evidence whether done at a single or at multiple events was conducted under controlled,
supervised conditions.
Equality and inclusion
This Unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to learning
or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when planning learning
experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative evidence.
Further advice can be found on our website www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.

should provide you with a good grounding in this subject area. For those who have studied digital
electronics in an earlier course this Unit will provide some opportunities for revision.
The Unit will enable you to understand digital electronic systems. On completion of the Unit you
should be able to read and draw circuit diagrams containing standard digital devices. You should also
be able to use computer software to simulate and test functionality prior to the construction of digital
circuits.
By the end of the Unit you will be expected to explain combinational and sequential circuit operation
and to construct digital circuits.
The final assessment will take the form of a short answer written test paper, lasting two hours, taken
under supervised, controlled closed-book conditions. You will not be allowed to take notes,
textbooks, etc, into the assessment. You will, however, have access to device data sheets. In order to
allow you to show evidence of practical expertise, there will be a two-hour build and test exercise.
This latter exercise is likely to be conducted in a laboratory at a different time from the written
assessment.SQA Advanced Unit (HT7M 48): Electrical Motor Drive Systems 1

Outcome 5 (8 hours)
Investigate the selection of motor and ancillary equipment for a given industrial load.
• The content for this Outcome is fully specified under Outcome 5 in the SQA Advanced Unit
specification: statement of standards section.
Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit has been designed to initially take a systems approach to electrical motor drive systems via
a block diagram approach. Individual parts of the system (eg transmission arrangements, electrical
protection and starting and braking) are then analysed in greater depth. The operation and
performance characteristics of electrical motors are not considered in this Unit as they are dealt with
in some detail in the Unit, Electrical Machines Principles. Centres delivering this Unit are strongly
encouraged to allow candidates to view as many electric motor drive system component parts as
possible. This may be achieved through the parts of motor drive systems being available at the centre
or by visits to appropriate industrial or commercial premises. Good charts and other visual aids
showing complete and disassembled parts of various elements of electrical motor drive systems will
also be a good aid to candidate learning. The Internet provides a rich source of information on
transmission systems, electrical protection and starting and braking components and candidates
should be actively encouraged to explore sites which contain helpful information. Likewise
manufacturers’ catalogues and datasheets also contain useful sources of information on motor drive
system components.
Information on evidence requirements and assessment guidelines are given after Outcomes 4 and 5 in
the SQA Advanced Unit specification: statement of standards section. The written assessment paper
should take place after Outcomes 1 to 4 have been completed and the assignment would normally be
undertaken following the written test.
Open learning
This Unit could be delivered by distance learning, which may incorporate some degree of online
support. However, with regards to assessment, planning would be required by the centre concerned to
ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence. Arrangements would be required to be
put in place to ensure that assessment, whether done at a single or multiple events, was conducted
under controlled, supervised conditions.
To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that for distance learning
candidates the assessment paper is taken at a single assessment event.
Equality and inclusion
This Unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to learning
or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when planning learning
experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative evidence.
Further advice can be found on our website www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.

SQA Advanced Unit (HT7M 48): Electrical Motor Drive Systems 11
General information for candidates
Unit title: Electrical Motor Drive Systems
It is important to recognise that an electrical motor is normally part of an overall system which drives
a given load. The system will also contain some form of mechanical transmission arrangement (eg a
coupling, pulley or gearbox) to transmit the motor’s torque to the load. The system will have
electrical protection to protect the motor against adverse electrical and mechanical conditions and
both starting and braking arrangements to start and stop the motor.
In this Unit you will first consider electrical motor drive systems at a system’s level and then you will
look in greater depth at individual parts of the system (eg transmission systems, electrical protection
and starting and braking methods). You will also be provided with an opportunity to consolidate your
knowledge and understanding of motor drive systems by undertaking an investigation of motor and
ancillary equipment for a given industrial load.
There are plenty of good learning materials available both in paper format and via the Internet on
motor drive systems and the component parts of these systems. Your lecturer is likely to strongly
encourage you to explore manufacturers’ catalogues, datasheets and investigate Internet sites to find
out more about motor drive systems and their component parts.
Assessment for this Unit will comprise of a two hour written test following the delivery of Outcomes
1 to 4 followed by an assignment in which you will have an opportunity to investigate the selection of
motor, transmission system, electrical protection and starting and braking methods in an industrial or
commercial electrical motor drive system.Unit (HV2K 47): Industrial Plant Maintenance 1

Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
This Unit provides many of the core mathematical principles and processes required when
studying Engineering at a more advanced level. Given the nature of the subject matter in the
Unit it is advisable that the Unit is not delivered until learners have studied Engineering
Mathematics 3.
Centres may deliver the Outcomes in any order they wish.
The Unit may be delivery using a didactic approach. All teaching input should be
supplemented by a significant level of formative assessment in which learners are provided
with opportunities to develop their knowledge, understanding and skills of the mathematical
topics covered in the Unit. Alternatively, as learners taking this Unit may be preparing to
enter an degree course at university (possibly at an advanced level) the Unit could be
delivered as a series of lectures supported by tutorial sessions to help learners prepare
better for future university studies.
Computer software and computer algebra may be used to support learning (eg to confirm the
solutions of mathematical problems), but it is strongly recommended that such learning
resources are only used in a supportive capacity and not as the principal means of delivering
Unit content.
Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
The recommended approach is the use of an examination question paper. The question
paper should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer, restricted response
and structured questions. The questions in the examination should not be grouped by
Outcome or be labelled in terms of the Outcomes they relate to.
All assessment papers should be unseen by the learners prior to the assessment event and
at all times, the security, integrity and confidentiality of assessment papers must be ensured.
Assessment should be conducted under closed-book, controlled and invigilated conditions.
The summative assessment of all four Outcomes should not exceed two hours. When
assessing a learner’s responses to summative assessment lecturers should concentrate
principally on the learner’s ability to apply the correct mathematical technique and processes
when solving problems. Learners should not be penalised for making simple numerical
errors. An appropriate threshold score may be set for the assessment of this Unit.
Learners should be provided with a formulae sheet appropriate to the content of this Unit
when undertaking their assessment. Computer algebra should not be used in the
assessment of this Unit.

ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
work or further and higher education.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at

HT1R 47, Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers (SCQF level 7) 6
Evidence Requirements for Outcome 4
This is a practically based Outcome and all of the Knowledge and/or Skills items should be
assessed. The evidence should be presented in response to a practical, laboratory
assignment in which each learner is set the task of constructing and demonstrating the
operation of a circuit or system that incorporates a transducer.
A learner’s response can be judged to be satisfactory where evidence provided is sufficient
to meet the requirements for each item by showing that the learner is able to:
• Construct and demonstrate correct operation of a circuit or system that incorporates a
transducer
• Describe the operation of the circuit or system that has been constructed
• Measure and plot on a graph, the transducer’s output in response to changes at its input
Evidence of the practical aspects of this assignment should be recorded by centres in the
form of a checklist for each learner. Each learner is required to construct a circuit or system
independently, and then demonstrate to the Assessor its correct operation. If the learner’s
circuit or system does not operate properly, then the learner should be allowed to correct the
faults and retest the operation at the same assessment event.
On completion of the practical laboratory exercise, learners are required to submit a written
laboratory report. This report should include the following sections of information:
• purpose of the circuit or system, and relevant circuit or system diagram
• brief description of method of construction
• description of operation of the circuit or system
• record of measured input and output values for the transducer
• graph of transducer’s transfer characteristic (o/p versus i/p values)
• record of observations of the operation of the circuit or system
• analysis of recorded values, graph and observations
• conclusion conveying the success of the operation of the circuit or system
Centres should provide learners with details of the required report format. Although it should
be encouraged, it is not a requirement that learners use software packages to produce
documentation for their reports. Centres should make every reasonable effort to ensure that
each report is the learner’s own work.
The circuit or system that the learner is required to construct and demonstrate can be built
using discrete components, pre-constructed modules or a combination of both. Learners
should be issued with the circuit or system diagram along with a brief description of its
purpose. The circuit or system should be constructed in the laboratory under controlled,
supervised conditions, and the written report can be completed outwith the laboratory in the
learner’s own study time.

Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
Throughout the delivery of this Unit, reference should be made to practical examples of
control systems. A range of transducers should be available for learners to view. Practical
demonstrations and/or laboratory exercises showing the operation of transducers and model
control systems should be provided throughout the Unit.
This Unit has been developed as part of the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards. Where this Unit is incorporated into other Group
Awards it is recommended that it be delivered in the context of the specific occupational
area(s) that the award is designed to cover.
Details on approaches to assessment are given under Evidence Requirements and
Assessment guidelines under each Outcome in the SQA Advanced Unit specification:
statement of standards section. It is recommended that these sections be read carefully
before proceeding with assessment of learners.
The written assessment paper should take place after delivery of the Unit is complete.
The practical laboratory assignment can be carried out during the delivery of the Unit.
Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment. The following are
suggestions only. There may be other methods that would be more suitable to learners.
Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
work or further and higher education.
The assessment for all Outcomes 1, 2 and 3 in this Unit should be combined together into
one written assessment paper. This paper should be taken by learners at one single
assessment event that should last two hours. The assessment paper should be composed of
a suitable balance of short answer, restricted response and structured questions. This
assessment should be carried out at the end of the delivery of the Unit and be conducted
under controlled, supervised conditions.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HT1R 47, Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers (SCQF level 7) 11
Outcome 4 should be assessed by a practical, laboratory assignment in which each learner
is set the task of constructing and demonstrating the operation of a circuit or system that
incorporates a transducer. On successful completion of the practical aspects of this
assignment, learners should be required to submit a written laboratory report. The time that
should be allocated in the laboratory for this assignment is 2 hours. However, learners
should be allowed to complete the written report outwith the laboratory in their own study
time. The assessment for Outcome 4 should be carried out at a suitable time during the
delivery of the Unit.
Assessment Guidelines
Outcomes 13
The assessment for Outcomes 1, 2 and 3 should be combined together to form one
assessment paper. This single assessment paper should be taken at a single assessment
event lasting two hours and be carried out under supervised, controlled conditions. Such a
paper should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer, restricted response
and structured questions. This assessment should be taken at the end of the Unit.
Outcome 4
The assessment of this Outcome should take the form of a practical, laboratory assignment
which can be carried out at a suitable time during the delivery of the Unit. The time that
should be allocated in the laboratory for this assignment is 2 hours. However, learners
should be allowed to complete the written report outwith the laboratory in their own study
time. It is recommended that centres develop checklists to support the assessment
requirements for each of the Knowledge and/or Skills items.
It is essential that centres ensure that evidence generated is the learner’s own work. Centres
can choose to issue each learner with the same circuit or system to be constructed, or a
different circuit or system to be constructed. If different circuits or systems are issued then
each one must possess the same degree of difficulty.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.

General information for learners
Unit title: Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers
(SCQF level 7)
This section will help you decide whether this is the Unit for you by explaining what the Unit
is about, what you should know or be able to do before you start, what you will need to do
during the Unit and opportunities for further learning and employment.
A control system consists of a number of components (which can be electrical, mechanical,
thermal or hydraulic) that act together to maintain a desired output in a process. Control
systems are used extensively in industries such as oil refining, electrical generation,
chemical processing, and manufacturing and production. Our homes and offices also use
control systems to regulate temperature and air conditioning. This Unit has been designed to
enable you to develop the necessary knowledge and skills so you to understand the structure
and general behaviour of different types of control systems.
The Unit takes a non-mathematical approach to control systems. You will learn how to
explain control system concepts, use block diagrams to model systems, and use graphical
methods to describe their behaviour.
You will begin the Unit by learning about the types of component parts that make up control
systems. You will also learn how information is transferred between the component parts by
means of analogue and digital signals. You will discover that the operation of a control
system is heavily influenced by its environment, and that the choice of equipment and signal
types depends on the location of the system. The need for signal conditioning devices such
as filters and amplifiers will be covered.
As you progress through the Unit, you will learn about different methods of controlling the
output of a process. Basic methods such as open loop control will be covered. However,
these have limitations and disadvantages. Therefore, you will learn about the need for closed
loop control systems which have the facility to measure the output variable being controlled,
so as to sense changes and enable corrective action to be taken to ensure that the output of
the system is maintained at the desired value. Such control systems include temperature
control and flow control of liquids. You will also develop knowledge and skills to enable you
to understand how controllers can be used to modify the way open and closed loop control
systems respond (with respect to speed of response, damping, and transient and steady
state response).
Closed loop control systems incorporate devices called transducers. These accept energy in
one form eg heat and produce output energy in some other form such as an electrical signal.
You will study the operation and application of a range of transducers suitable for measuring
variables such as temperature, flow, displacement, velocity, pressure, strain, position, level
and light. In addition, you will have the opportunity to construct circuits and systems that
incorporate transducers. You will measure the characteristics of transducers, and study the
overall operation of the circuits and systems that you build.
By the end of this Unit you should possess the knowledge and skills to enable you to: explain
control system elements and signals; explain the operation and application of a range of
transducers; describe the structure and behaviour of control systems; and demonstrate the
application of transducers in control systems.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HT1R 47, Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers (SCQF level 7) 15
The formal assessment for the Unit will consist of a both a written assessment paper lasting
two hours and a laboratory assignment lasting two hours.
The written assessment paper will be conducted under closed-book conditions and you will
not be allowed to take notes, textbooks etc into the assessment. You will sit this assessment
paper at the end of the delivery of the Unit.
The laboratory assignment will require you to construct and demonstrate the operation of a
circuit or system that incorporates a transducer. This will be carried out during a two hour
laboratory session at a suitable time during the delivery of the Unit. On successful completion
of the practical aspects of this assignment, you will be required to submit a written laboratory
report.

Evidence Requirements for this Unit
Outcome 1
Evidence for the Knowledge and/or Skills in this Outcome will be generated through
sampling. Each learner will need to provide evidence to demonstrate they can analyse two of
the four technologies and factors associated with traditional methods of energy production.
The evidence should be responses to specific questions.
To ensure that learners will not be able to foresee all the items they will be questioned about,
a different sample should be used on successive assessment occasions. The new sample
may contain a maximum of one of the Knowledge and/or Skills used in the previous
assessment occasion.
A learner’s response can be judged to be satisfactory where the evidence shows that the
learner can:
• Describe the key components of the chosen technology.
• Explain the principles of operation of the chosen technology.
• Explain the operational aspects of the chosen technology.
• Describe the environmental and sustainability factors of the chosen technology.
• Determine the energy produced using supplied data for the chosen technology.

conditions.
Outcome 2
Evidence for the Knowledge and/or Skills in this Outcome will be generated through
sampling. Each learner will need to provide evidence to demonstrate they can analyse three
of the seven technologies and factors associated with renewable methods of energy
production. Each sample should consist of one wind and one hydro technology plus one from
either solar or biomass. The evidence should be responses to specific questions.
To ensure that learners will not be able to foresee all the items they will be questioned about,
successive assessment occasions should contain a different sample. As before, the
requirement for one wind and one hydro to be included is valid although the choice of which
wind (onshore or offshore) and which hydro (catchment or pumped storage) may be
changed. The same solar technology cannot be used on the next assessment occasion. If
SQA Advanced Unit Specification

learner can:
• Describe the key components of the chosen technology.
• Explain the principles of operation of the chosen technology.
• Explain the operational aspects of the chosen technology.
• Describe the environmental and sustainability factors of the chosen technology.
• Determine the energy produced using supplied data for the chosen technology.

the energy conversion process from input through to output. Each stage in the process
should be explained in terms of its function/operation. Operational aspects should include
typical overall plant efficiencies, start-up time, utilisation for base or peak loads, reliability of
supply and CO2 emissions per Unit of energy generated (gCO2/kWh). Environmental and
sustainability factors and the significance of each will vary depending on the technology but
would typically include several of the following:
• Use of finite fossil fuels
• CO2 released into atmosphere
• Visual amenity and noise impacts

Outcome 2
For each of the technologies, diagrams should be used showing the key components in the
energy conversion process from input through to output. Each stage in the process should be
explained in terms of its function/operation. Operational aspects should include typical overall
plant (or Unit) efficiency, weather constraints, logistics (for offshore wind), reliability of supply
and CO2 emissions per Unit of energy generated (gCO2/kWh). Environmental and
sustainability factors and the significance of each will vary depending on the technology but
would typically include several of the following:
• Use of renewable resources
• CO2 released into atmosphere
• Visual amenity and noise impacts
• Air, land and water pollution
• Land-loss (large hydro schemes in particular)
• Impact on wildlife, marine life and ecological systems
• Waste products
Outcome 3
Marine (wave and tidal) technologies are expected to contribute to the future energy ‘mix’. At
present, worldwide there are only a few operational marine power plants. Technologies to
harness energy from the tide include tidal barrage and tidal stream. The European Marine
Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney is one of the world’s leading marine technology research
and testing centres and a useful source of information. Currently, there are several types of
wave energy technologies at various stages of development. In the UK, examples include the
‘Pelamis’ attenuator system, the ‘Limpet’ oscillating water column system and the ‘Oyster’
oscillating wave surge convertor system. Energy production from geothermal sources utilises
three main technologies and currently the US is the largest producer of geothermal energy.
Historically, energy from waste has been via incineration however more recent technologies
such as gasification and pyrolysis are now being commissioned. It is suggested that the
following technologies be used in the delivery of this Outcome:
Tidal: Tidal barrage and Tidal stream
Wave: Attenuator systems, Oscillating water column systems and Oscillating wave
surge convertor systems
Geothermal: Dry steam, Flash steam and Binary cycle
Waste: Incineration and Advanced Thermal Treatments (Gasification and Pyrolysis)
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HT1L 48, Energy Technologies (SCQF level 8) 8
For each of the technologies, diagrams should be used showing the key components in the
energy conversion process from input through to output. Each stage in the process should be
explained in terms of its function/operation. Operational aspects should include typical overall
plant (or Unit) efficiency (where data is available), logistics (for waste), reliability of supply
and CO2 emissions per Unit of energy generated (gCO2/kWh). Environmental and
sustainability factors and the significance of each will vary depending on the technology but
would typically include several of the following:
• Use of renewable/sustainable resources
• CO2 released into atmosphere
• Visual amenity and noise impacts
• Air, land and water pollution
• Impact on wildlife, marine life and ecological systems (tidal barrage in particular)
• Waste products
Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
This Unit should be delivered in year 2 of an SQA Advanced Diploma programme. It would
be beneficial if learners had previously completed the level 7 Unit Energy Overview. It is
unlikely that it could be delivered through integration with other Units.
It would be beneficial if learners had classroom internet access. It is suggested that an equal
amount of time be allocated to each Outcome.
Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment. The following are
suggestions only. There may be other methods that would be more suitable to learners.
All Outcomes should be assessed on a sample basis.
Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
work or further and higher education.
The Unit may be assessed on an Outcome by Outcome basis or through a combination of
Outcomes.
Outcome 1
This Outcome may be assessed individually or in combination with Outcomes 2 and/or 3.
Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
conditions.
Outcome 2
This Outcome may be assessed individually or in combination with Outcomes 1 and/or 3.
Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
conditions.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HT1L 48, Energy Technologies (SCQF level 8) 9
Outcome 3
This Outcome may be assessed individually or in combination with Outcomes 1 and/or 2.
Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
conditions.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
Some Core Skills may be developed through the delivery of this Unit.
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) may be developed in all Unit Outcomes
and in particular, the use of the internet to search for flowcharts, block diagrams and
animations associated with each of the technologies.
Numeracy may be developed in Outcomes 1 and 2 in relation to the determination of energy
output.

General information for learners
Unit title: Energy Technologies
This section will help you decide whether this is the Unit for you by explaining what the Unit
is about, what you should know or be able to do before you start, what you will need to do
during the Unit and opportunities for further learning and employment.
The Unit is designed to introduce a range of technologies associated with energy production.
The technologies will be classified as traditional, renewable, and emerging and less common
sustainable methods, for the purposes of this Unit. Traditional (existing) methods are based
upon fossil fuel technologies and nuclear. Renewable methods are based upon the utilisation
of non-fossil fuel based technologies. Emerging and less common sustainable methods are
based upon technologies that are currently at various stages of development, implementation
or operation together with technologies that are operational but are, overall, small energy
producers relative to traditional and renewable methods.
The Unit is optional for learners on related SQA Advanced Engineering Awards. It could also
be used as a stand-alone Unit where appropriate. No prior knowledge is required although it
would be beneficial if learners have previously completed the level 7 Unit Energy Overview
and were familiar with using the internet for research purposes.
Outcome 1 has been designed to introduce traditional methods of energy production using
coal, gas, oil and nuclear fuel sources. Typical power plant operation and processes will be
explained detailing energy input through to energy output. Operational aspects,
environmental and sustainability issues and numerical calculations pertaining to each
technology will also be considered.
Outcome 2 has been designed to introduce renewable methods of energy production using
wind, hydro, solar and biomass technologies. Typical power plant or device operation and
processes will be explained detailing energy input through to energy output. Operational
aspects, environmental and sustainability issues and numerical calculations pertaining to
each technology will also be considered.
Outcome 3 has been designed to introduce emerging and/or less common sustainable
methods of energy production. Tidal, wave, geothermal and waste technologies will be
considered. Typical power plant or device operation and processes will be explained
detailing energy input through to energy output. Operational aspects and environmental and
sustainability issues pertaining to each technology will also be considered.
In order to achieve this Unit, all Outcomes must be achieved. This Unit will be assessed by
responses to structured questions under closed-book conditions.
There is no automatic certification of Core Skills or Core Skill components in this Unit.
The Unit has been designed to support articulation routes to degree programmes and also to
support employment opportunities in the energy sector.SQA Advanced Unit Specification

Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
This Unit provides core mathematical principles and processes which underpin much of the
studies undertaken in a number of SQA Advanced Qualifications across a range of
engineering disciplines. It is recommended that the Unit be delivered towards the beginning
of these awards.
Centres may deliver the Outcomes in any order they wish, it is recommended that Outcome
1 is delivered first followed by Outcomes 2 and then Outcome 3.
It is recommended that Unit delivery is principally undertaken using a didactic approach. All
teaching input should be supplemented by a significant level of formative assessment in
which learners are provided with opportunities to develop their knowledge, understanding
and skills of the mathematical topics covered in the Unit. Computer software and computer
algebra may be used to support learning (eg to confirm the solutions of mathematical
problems), but it is strongly recommended that such learning resources are only used in a
supportive capacity and not as the principal means of delivering Unit content.
Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HP48 46 Engineering Mathematics 1 (SCQF level 6) 9
A recommended approach is the use of an examination question paper. The question paper
should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer, restricted response and
structured questions.
All assessment papers should be unseen by learners prior to the assessment event and at all
times, the security, integrity and confidentiality of assessment papers must be ensured.
Assessment should be conducted under closed-book, controlled and invigilated conditions.
The questions in the examination should not be grouped by Outcome or be labelled in terms
of the Outcomes they relate to when a single end-of-Unit examination is used.
The summative assessment of all three Outcomes — whether individually or at a single
assessment event — should not exceed two hours. When assessing a learner’s responses to
summative assessment lecturers should concentrate principally on the candidate’s ability to
apply the correct mathematical technique and processes when solving problems. Candidates
should not be penalised for making simple numerical errors. An appropriate threshold score
may be set for the assessment of this Unit. A threshold score should be used for each
assessment if Outcome level assessment is used.
Learners should be provided with a formulae sheet appropriate to the content of this Unit
when undertaking their assessment. Computer algebra should not be used in the
assessment of this Unit.
It is the learner’s responsibility to ensure that any calculator they use during assessment are
not designed or adapted to offer any of the following facilities:
• language translators
• symbolic algebra manipulation
• complex number manipulation
• communication with other machines or the internet.
In addition, any calculator used by learners should have no retrievable information stored in
them. This includes:
• data banks
• dictionaries
• mathematical formulae
Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
work or further and higher education.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at www.sqa.org.uk/e-
assessment.

Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
This Unit provides core mathematical principles and processes which underpin much of the
studies undertaken in a number of SQA Advanced Qualifications across a range of
Engineering disciplines. It is recommended that the Unit be delivered towards the beginning
of these awards.
Centres may deliver the Outcomes in any order they wish, it is recommended that Outcome
1 is delivered first followed by Outcomes 2 and then Outcome 3.
It is recommended that Unit delivery is principally undertaken using a didactic approach. All
teaching input should be supplemented by a significant level of formative assessment in
which learners are provided with opportunities to develop their knowledge, understanding
and skills of the mathematical topics covered in the Unit. Computer software and computer
algebra may be used to support learning (egto confirm the solutions of mathematical
problems), but it is strongly recommended that such learning resources are only used in a
supportive capacity and not as the principal means of delivering Unit content.
Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment.
A recommended approach is the use of an examination question paper. The question paper
should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer, restricted response and
structured questions.
All assessment papers should be unseen by learners prior to the assessment event and at all
times, the security, integrity and confidentiality of assessment papers must be ensured.
Assessment should be conducted under closed-book, controlled and invigilated conditions.
The questions in the examination should not be grouped by Outcome or be labelled in terms
of the Outcomes they relate to when a single end-of-Unit examination is used.
The summative assessment of all three Outcomes — whether individually or at a single
assessment event - should not exceed two hours. When assessing a learner’s responses to
summative assessment lecturers should concentrate principally on the learner’s ability to
apply the correct mathematical technique and processes when solving problems. Learners
should not be penalised for making simple numerical errors. An appropriate threshold score
may be set for the assessment of this Unit. A threshold score should be used for each
assessment if Outcome level assessment is used.
Learners should be provided with a formulae sheet appropriate to the content of this Unit
when undertaking their assessment. Computer algebra should not be used in the
assessment of this Unit.
It is the learners’ responsibility to ensure that any calculator they use during assessment are
not designed or adapted to offer any of the following facilities:
• language translators
• symbolic algebra manipulation
• symbolic differentiation or integration
• communication with other machines or the internet
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
HP49 47 Engineering Mathematics 2 (SCQF level 7) 9
In addition, any calculator used by learners should have no retrievable information stored in
them. This includes:
• databanks
• dictionaries
• mathematic formulae
Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
work or further and higher education.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
This Unit has the Using Number component of Numeracy embedded in it. This means that
when candidates achieve the Unit, their Core Skills profile will also be updated to show that
they have achieved Using Number at SCQF level 6.

General information for candidates
Unit title: Electrical Safety
This Unit has been designed to allow you to develop an appreciation of electrical safety and
to further your knowledge and understanding of the requirements and features of permit-to-
work systems in relation to electrical systems.
The Unit will provide you with an appreciation of the need for assessing the risks associated
with working with electrical systems and equipment and the importance of ensuring that
such systems are properly isolated from the supply prior to any work being carried out. It
introduces the concept of an ‘operational plan’ for safe working on electrical systems and
develops the features of such a plan.
It is important that, before you carry out any work on an electrical system, you understand
the features of such a system and how its component parts work together. The Unit
develops this theme in Outcome 2 which describes the features of such a distribution system
and the features of a safe isolation procedure on any relevant section of the network.
Outcome 3 allows you to develop your understanding of permit-to-work systems and
highlights the responsibilities and duties of responsible personnel under such systems. You
will have the opportunity to complete permit-to-work documents.
On completion of this Unit you should have a good appreciation of the need for and
requirements of electrical safety schemes and will be able to implement a generic permit-to-
work system.
The formal assessment of this Unit is in two parts. Firstly, you will be expected to undertake
a closed, book written assessment on your appreciation of the features of operational plans
and electrical distribution systems. Secondly, you will be required to complete an
assignment which involves carrying out a case study for situation which requires a permit-to-SQA Advanced Unit (HV53 48): Electrical Standby Systems 1

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this unit
The subjects of standby generators and UPS are both large and lecturers need to be realistic about
what it is possible to deliver in the time available. Lecturers should select examples of standby
generators and UPS which are typically used in modern industrial or commercial applications.
Centres delivering this unit are strongly encouraged to allow candidates to view as many practical
battery, generator and UPS systems as possible. This may be achieved through the presence of such
systems in the centre or by visits to appropriate industrial or commercial premises. Good charts and
other visual aids showing complete and disassembled parts of battery, generator and UPS systems
will also be a good aid to candidate learning. The internet provides a rich source of information on
batteries, standby/emergency generators and UPS, and candidates should be actively encouraged to
explore sites which contain helpful information. Likewise manufacturers’ catalogues and data sheets
also contain useful sources of information particularly with regard to the performance characteristics
of batteries, generators and UPS.
Information on evidence requirements and assessment guidelines is given after Outcome 3 in the
SQA Advanced Unit specification: statement of standards section. The written assessment paper
should take place after Outcomes 1 to 3 have been completed.
Open learning
This unit could be delivered by distance learning, which may incorporate some degree of online
support. However, with regards to assessment, planning would be required by the centre concerned to
ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence.
Arrangements would be required to be put in place to ensure that assessment, whether done at a
single or multiple events, was conducted under controlled, supervised conditions.
To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that for distance learning
candidates the assessment paper is taken at a single assessment event.
Equality and inclusion
This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to learning
or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when planning learning
experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative evidence.
Further advice can be found on our website www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.

General information for candidates
Unit title: Electrical Standby Systems
Standby, or back-up, systems are very important in Electrical Engineering as they ensure the
maintenance of electrical energy when other power systems fail.
In this unit you will examine three types of back-up systems: namely batteries, generators and UPS
(uninterruptible power supplies). Batteries come in many shapes and sizes and different battery types
are more suitable for particular applications. In this unit you will learn about the construction and
principles of operation of basic batteries and the characteristics and applications of a range of
different battery types.
The subject of standby generators is very large and it would be impossible to teach you all about
them in one unit. In this unit you will learn about the construction and principle of operation of
different types of standby generator, how generators are driven, the key performance characteristics
of generators, and other technical requirements relating to generator operation including control,
electrical protection, installation, safety and maintenance.
UPS (uninterruptible power supplies) are used widely in industry and commerce. In this unit you will
learn about the basic function of this type of power supply. How they are constructed and operate,
what their key performance characteristics are, how to ‘size’ them to supply different types of
equipment and how software can be used to control some of their operations.
There are plenty of good learning materials available both in paper format and via the internet on
batteries, standby generators and UPS. Your lecturer is likely to strongly encourage you to exploreUnit (HV3K 47): Electrical Systems in Potentially Explosive and Gas Hazardous Environments 1

General information for candidates
Unit title: Electrical Systems in Potentially Explosive and Gas Hazardous
Environments
This Unit has been designed to provide you with an opportunity to develop your knowledge and
understanding of electrical installations and equipment in potentially explosive and hazardous
environments. If you already have some experience of working with installations in such
environments, you will be familiar with the principles and concepts of Outcomes 1 and 2 and may
even have some knowledge of the protection methods of Outcomes 3 and 4.
The Unit begins by considering the dangers associated with operating electrical plant and equipment
in hazardous environments and allows you to develop an appreciation of the factors which come
together to create dangerous situations.
The Unit then considers the need for legislation and the requirements for certification of equipment to
be used in hazardous environments. It considers the need for information to be readily available to the
designers and installers of equipment in such conditions and allows you to develop your knowledge of
equipment marking standards and labelling requirements.
An awareness of the constructional features and methods used to protect electrical power equipment
and intrinsically safe equipment is then developed and you will be able to develop your knowledge of
both these protection methods.
By the end of this Unit you should have a good appreciation of the requirements of electrical plant
and equipment suitable for use in potentially explosive and gas hazardous environments and the
methods of reducing the risks associated with operating electrical plant in such environments.
The formal assessment of this Unit will consist of two assessment papers, each lasting one hour.
These assessments will be conducted under closed book conditions in which you will not be allowed
to take notes, textbooks etc into the assessment. You will sit the first assessment (Outcomes 1 & 2)

In designing this Unit the Unit writer has identified the range of topics expected to be covered by
lecturers. The writer has also given recommendations as to how much time should be spent on each
Outcome. This has been done to help lecturers to decide what depth of treatment should be given to
the topics attached to each of the Outcomes. Whilst it is not mandatory for centres to use this list of
topics it is strongly recommended that they do so to ensure continuity of teaching and learning across
Electrical Units. In addition, the assessment exemplar pack for this Unit is based on the knowledge
and/or skills and list of topics in each of the Outcomes.
A list of topics is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list of topics in conjunction with the
assessment exemplar pack so that they can obtain a clear indication of the standard of achievement
expected of candidates who undertake study of this Unit.

Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
This Unit may be taught as a freestanding Unit, however it also could be combined with appropriate
Unit(s) to allow integration of related topics.
It is designed to introduce the candidate to a general electricity supply system and then to provide
greater knowledge in; distribution, faults and system efficiency. These are pertinent topics for those
working with the supply system or industrial installations. Thus the Unit should appeal to a wide
range of candidates.
Delivery of Outcome 1 should be such as to equip the candidate with knowledge of the fundamental
components of the electricity supply system.
Delivery of Outcome 2 should focus on harmonics and the need to reduce their influence by filtering.
Where possible an industrial visit could be carried out and linked to the assignment that covers
Outcomes 1 and 2. If such is not possible other supplementary information could be used to support
delivery. (eg guest speakers, video clips) While it is not possible to provide every candidate with a
unique assignment, where possible a degree of variety should be introduced to help avoid plagiarism.
Outcome 3 is devoted to faults and calculation of fault levels. Delivery could be centred around 11kV,
or equivalent, voltages to allow relevance to as wide a range of candidates as possible, however
individual centres may wish to focus on fault level calculations based on other voltage levels.
Delivery of Outcome 4 should focus power factor improvement as a means of improving power
system efficiency. Where possible small scale practical work could be implemented.
Assessment of this Unit falls into two areas. One written assessment towards the end of the Unit sat
under controlled, supervised conditions and one assignment. It is recommended that the assignment is
presented to the candidates during delivery of Outcome 1 and that it could be submitted
approximately half way through the delivery of the Unit to allow for an even spread of assessment.
Open learning
This Unit could be delivered on an open learning basis. The centre would have to ensure that the
written assessment was carried out under controlled and supervised conditions. In addition the
authenticity of assignments carried out, out with the centre, would need to be proved.

General information for candidates
Unit title: Electricity Power Systems
The electricity power system of Europe and parts of Asia is arguably one of the largest, if not the
largest, industrial system and infrastructure in the world. Similar systems exist in most other
continents. This Unit has been designed to introduce you to such a system. While it has been written
with the UK supply system in mind, there is built in flexibility to allow your tutor to use the regional
supply system wherever you are. In addition it is recognised that aspects of the electricity supply are
equally relevant to engineers working in industries that have high electrical power consumption.
Thus, after the introduction, this Unit focuses on some aspects of electricity power systems that are
equally valid to industrial engineers as well as electricity supply engineers.
The Unit is divided into four Outcomes. In Outcome 1 you are introduced to the function of each of
the main items of plant found in a supply system as well as how to represent the complex system by
means of a single line schematic diagram. You are then taken further with a more detailed study of the
electrical distribution system and the loads connected to it. The UK standard voltages are 11 kV and
33 kV on this system. Outcome 2 looks at the increasingly important area of harmonics and filtering
in order to reduce their pollution. Outcome 3 provides a detailed look, by means of calculation, at the
maximum fault level at points within the electrical system. Fault level is usually expressed in MVA
and is set at a maximum of 250 MVA for 11 kV and 100 MVA for 33 kV in the UK. Or in other
words, for the 11 kV system, the maximum fault current permitted is approximately 13 kA. Note that
your tutor may prefer to focus fault level calculations on the transmission system. The final Outcome
focuses on the means of improving the efficiency of the supply system by power factor improvement
to reduce the system I2R losses.SQA Advanced Unit Specification

• negotiate and agree with other group members rules for the management of the group
which will ensure that the objectives of the task will be met and that all components
of it will be carried out.
3. Confirmation that the personal report is a true record of what took place. This must be
given by someone with responsibility for and knowledge of the candidate’s contribution
and will take the form of a signed statement.
4. Relevant workplace documentation to support the personal report. This can include any
material arising from the planning of the task which can illustrate the contribution of the
candidate. Examples might be work plans or schedules, notes of team briefings, minutes
of meetings, requisition documents, written instruction, memos, e-mails, print-outs etc.
This portfolio of evidence should be signed as authentic by the person responsible for the
candidate’s work.
Assessment guidelines
The assessment for this Outcome can be combined with Outcomes 2 and 3 as part of a single
assessment instrument for the Unit, details of which are given under Outcome 3 below.
SQA Advanced Unit Specification
Unit HR1D 47: Employment Experience 2 5
August 2017
Outcome 2
Implement a workplace task in co-operation with others
Knowledge and/or skills
• building and maintaining interpersonal relationships
• group decision making
• the process of monitoring and control
• importance of meeting legal and organisational requirements
Evidence requirements
These should be read in conjunction with the evidence requirements for Outcome 1 which set
out the requirements of the task. It should be the same task which the candidate helped to
analyse and plan in Outcome 1.
Each candidate will need evidence to show that s/he can implement a workplace task by
working co-operatively with others. The evidence must show that s/he can anticipate the
needs of others and contribute to group decisions as well as keeping others informed of
progress and any difficulties that may arise and their implications.
The evidence provided should demonstrate that the candidate played an active and
constructive role in supporting co-operative working during the implementation of the
workplace task by clearly indicating the candidate’s precise contribution. The evidence
should include:
1. A personal report by the candidate explaining his/her contribution to the implementation
of the task and how this involved working co-operatively with others. The personal report
must cover each of the knowledge and/or skills items and must show that the candidate is
able to, in conjunction with others:
• anticipate the needs of others by recognising those who may be affected by any
development and/or changes in the implementation of the task and alerting them in
good time
• keep others informed timeously of his/her contribution to the progress of the task and
of any difficulties that may arise and the implications of these
• make an effective contribution to decisions made by the group involved in the
implementation of the task
• complete his/her contribution to the implementation of the task in accordance with
legal and organisational requirements such as health and safety.
2. Confirmation that the personal report is a true record of what took place. This must be
given by someone with knowledge of the candidate’s contribution and will normally take
the form of a signed statement.
3. Relevant workplace documentation to support the personal report. This can include any
material arising from the implementation of the task which can illustrate the contribution
of the candidate. Examples might be notes of team briefings, minutes of meetings,
memos, notes or e-mails to and from others, progress reports, work in progress dockets,
print-outs, etc. This portfolio of evidence should be signed as authentic by the person
responsible for the candidate’s work.

________________________________________
Editing this README
When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to makeareadme.com for this template.
Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.
Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.
Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.
Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.
Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.
Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project

Follow these recommendations to build your Agility capabilities.
Install and configure Tableau Server
Understanding how your hardware, network, databases, and applications interoperate is the first step in planning your Tableau
Server installation. Documenting this will give you insight for installation and configuration and ongoing platform operations.
1. Review the Tableau Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Complete the Enterprise Architecture Survey in the Tableau Blueprint Planner.
3. Leverage these insights to install and configure Tableau Server. For step-by-step guidance, visit the Tableau Help
documentation for the Tableau Server products you're implementing.
4. Explore Server Rapid Start to optimize your server installation. Work with our experts to ensure a successful and stable
Tableau Server environment with a plan for monitoring the scalable growth of users, content, and interactivity.
Configure user authentication and authorization for Tableau Server
To deploy Tableau, you will need to define authentication and authorization protocols for users in your organization.
1. Review the Authentication and Authorization section of Tableau Blueprint. For more detailed guidance and
configuration instructions, review the Tableau Server Help documentation on Authentication (Windows | Linux).
2. Configure either a local identity store or an external identity store at time of install.
3. Choose a Tableau Server authentication method that is compatible with your identity store.
Manage Tableau licenses
Licenses should be managed according to your organization's software license processes for allocating to new Tableau users,
changing Tableau license levels as analytical skills increase, and reclaiming available Tableau licenses when someone leaves
the company.
1. Review the Tableau License Management section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Define a process for allocating licenses to new Tableau users.
3. Define a process for changing Tableau license levels for current Tableau users.
4. Define a process for reclaiming Tableau licenses when someone leaves the company.
5. Enable license management features in your Tableau environment - Login-Based License Management and Grant
Role on Sign In - and update processes accordingly.
6. Document this information, and it to your Enablement Intranet.
Deploy client software (Desktop/Prep Builder)
Distributing Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder (for Creators) can be done in a few different ways. Determine and
document the process.
1. Review the Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Determine if you want to customize the install (e.g., no prompts, inclusion of drivers, etc.) and configure your process
accordingly.
3. If virtual desktop support is required, determine how you want to manage license deactivation.
4. Configure Tableau Desktop license usage reporting to gather usage information for individual instances of Tableau
Desktop.
5. Document this information, and it to your Enablement Intranet.
Configure back-up and restore
A Tableau Server administrator should perform daily backups of Tableau Server and its data. Taking these steps can help
ensure that Tableau Server runs with minimum loss.
1. Review the Back-up and Restore section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Learn how to use the Tableau Services Manager (TSM) command line tool to back-up and restore Tableau data,
including Tableau Server's own PostgreSQL database, which stores workbook and user metadata, data extract files,
server configuration data, and log files.
3. Define a cadence for performing back ups using the TSM command line tool.
4. Perform back-ups in accordance with your planned cadence.
Monitor Tableau Server process status
In order to ensure continued performance, your administrator should have a process in place for monitoring the Tableau
Server process status and a documented plan of action for when the process is "down" or "status unavailable".
1. Review the Tableau Server Process Status section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Determine how you will monitor, at minimum, process state changes, especially "Down" and "Status unavailable".
3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond if a process is not running as expected (e.g., who will support the
issue, where will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).
4. If you've purchased Tableau Advanced Management, explore the Resource Monitoring Tool to gain a comprehensive
look at the health of Tableau Server, including process status. Contact your Account Team if you're interested in
Tableau Advanced Management.
Monitor Backgrounder jobs
The Backgrounder process runs server jobs, including extract refreshes, subscriptions, flow runs, and data-driven alerts.
Administrators and users will want to know when these processes fail so corrective action can be taken.
1. Review the Built-in Alerts section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on leveraging built-in alerts to monitor for
background job failures.
2. Provide enablement to Administrators, and the Creator user base more broadly, on how built-in alerts can be leveraged
for process failures, such as extract refresh failures, flow run failures, etc.
3. Provide enablement to Administrators, and the Creator user base more broadly, on how they can reinitiate the process
manually using, in most cases, "Run Now".
4. Administrators may also want to develop similar processes using the REST API or tabcmd commands as a fail safe in
case process owners are out of the office.
5. Document guidance on how users can review Backgrounder jobs, and post this information to your Enablement
Intranet.
Configure built-in alerts
Alerts provide critical information about platform outages so you can take immediate action to triage the issue, communicate
with users, etc.
1. Review the Built-in Alerts section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Configure notifications about system alerts and failures (e.g., process status, drive space constraints, etc.) during
installation.
3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond when an alert is triggered (e.g., who will support the issue, where
will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).
Review performance thresholds
Administrative views are dashboards that are included with Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud and help you understand system
utilization and how users are interacting with content so that you can proactively monitor system activity and other scheduled
tasks.
1. Review the Administrative Views for Monitoring section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on monitoring performance
thresholds.
2. Leverage default or custom administrative views (or utilize the Dashboard Load Times Accelerator on our Tableau
exchange) to understand how Tableau is performing throughout the day, including background tasks to ensure they are
executing on time. These views should be leveraged to inform real-time action as well as trend analysis.
3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond when real-time action is needed (e.g., who will support the issue,
where will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).
4. Enable your teams by driving best-practice awareness into existing analytics community engagements, such as user
group meetings, analytics academies, and competitions.
5. Enact Performance Thresholds that work for your organization. Read more about this process with our blog, How to
Improve Dashboard Load Times with People and Processes.
Monitor license utilization
Monitoring licenses can help you administrators monitor usage and answer questions like who is using licenses, which types of
licenses they're using and if you need more or fewer licenses.
1. Review the Administrative Views for Monitoring section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on monitoring license
utilization.
2. Define a monthly cadence for reviewing license utilization details, including usage, availability, and upcoming
expirations.
3. Review license utilization in accordance with your planned cadence.
Define an upgrade process, including end-user communications plans
Defining the when and how on upgrades across all products in the Tableau platform includes decision points around upgrade
frequency, version selection, and version compatibility. When these areas are addressed early, administrators can better
manage users' expectations, rather than having to react to business demands for new features and functionality.
1. Review the Upgrades section Tableau Blueprint.
2. Define a cadence for performing platform upgrades, including Tableau Server, Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, and
Tableau Bridge.
3. Develop an enablement plan to prepare users for platform upgrades.
4. Develop a communications plan to inform users about platform upgrades, leveraging all channels available in your
organization.
5. Perform upgrades in accordance with your planned cadence.
6. Explore Server Upgrade where Tableau experts do the heavy lifting so you can quickly and successful upgrade your
environment and your team can produce deeper and more relevant findings by taking advantage of Tableau's newest
features.
Complete load test and capacity planning
Load testing helps you understand your Tableau Server’s capacity with respect to your unique environment, data, workload,
and usage profile. Capacity planning, by contrast, helps you ensure optimal Tableau Server performance and sufficient
capacity to handle increased workloads.
1. Review the Load Testing section and Capacity Planning section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Define a cadence for performing load testing. In general, this should be conducted two to four times a year in
conjunction with upgrades and server scale-up or scale-out expansions.
3. Define a cadence for performing capacity planning. Depending on the size of your organization, user demand, and
historical growth rates, you may need to do this at 6-month, quarterly, or monthly intervals.
4. Perform load testing and capacity planning in accordance with your planned cadence.
Perform database maintenance
Data maintenance creates free space on the Tableau Server deployments by deleting old files, including log files, temp files,
and rows from the http_request table.
1. Review the Database Maintenance section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Define a cadence for performing database maintenance.
3. Perform database maintenance in accordance with your planned cadence.
Deploy Tableau Mobile
Mobile business intelligence enables any user to make decisions no matter where they are. As a result, you should provide
users with the ability to access Tableau from anywhere.
1. Review the Tableau Mobile Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Gather organizational requirements for enterprise apps to better understand how you can control app delivery,
customize the sign-in experience, configure app policies, and provide additional security and governance controls.
3. Document guidance on how users can leverage Tableau Mobile, and post this information to your Enablement Intranet.
Install add-ons and extensions on Tableau Server
Tableau supports a robust extensibility framework for deep and complex enterprise integrations and embedded analytics
solutions. Define a process for how you will leverage these capabilities in your environment.
1. Review the Extensibility section of Tableau Blueprint.
2. Determine the extent to which you want to install add-ons and extensions to be deployed in the environment.
3. Document guidance on how users can request the installation of add-ons and extensions, and post this information to
your Enablement Intranet.

Get to Know Application Security 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe what an application is.
•	Define application security and its role in relation to application development.
What Is an Application? 
If you’ve ever used a computer, you’ve used an application. To define it, an application is a computer software package that performs one or more tasks and enables direct user interaction. But let’s break down what that really means by looking at examples of applications and how we use them.
Applications come in many forms such as database programs, web browsers, email clients, spreadsheets, media players, word processors, and image/photo editing software to name a few. Each of these software packages allows a user to interact directly with the application. For example, when you use word processing software, you interact directly with the application when you type, delete, or copy and paste text. And, you interact with applications in different ways—whether it’s on a computer using a photo editing software package like Photoshop, interacting with a mobile app on your smartphone, or conducting business transactions on a web-based banking application. That’s pretty straightforward, right? 
There are two ways developers create applications. They develop proprietary code that is not shared outside of an organization, or they develop code through open source projects, which are designed and developed in a public, collaborative manner with developers working together. 
Open source applications grant developers the right to use, study, and change the software, thus allowing it to be adapted and applied to a variety of use cases. There is an entire community dedicated to developing open source projects. As someone who may be interested in becoming an application security engineer, contributing to open source projects is a great way to get practical experience in application development and security while sharpening and proving your skills. As a result, you will better understand how applications are developed and function, and start to understand the role of application security in the coding and software development lifecycle.
The Role of Application Security 
In an organization’s technology stack, the application layer is the closest layer to the user. It allows interaction with the user and therefore provides the largest attack surface for intruders. Because of this, a relatively large number of security breaches are the result of application vulnerabilities. 
Applications can also provide a treasure trove of personal data an attacker would love to steal, tamper with, or destroy, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, national identification data (such as Social Security numbers), and email addresses. This means protecting applications is a key part of cybersecurity, in order to minimize the risks of data loss and the resulting negative financial, reputational, privacy, or legal impacts for an organization and its customers. 
Application security engineers need to think like an attacker to understand how an application could possibly be misused, while also ensuring that input provided by legitimate users is sanitized, validated, and processed safely by the application. 
Application security engineers focus on protecting applications in order to prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive data. Since it is much easier and less expensive to find security flaws in the early stages of software development, application security engineers should gather security requirements before any design or development work begins.
 Application security engineers work with development teams and business units to help design, create, document, code, test, deploy, and maintain secure applications. The process of designing and building applications is known as the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Application developers are responsible for the documentation and programming (coding) steps in this process. They write the source code that causes an application to carry out its desired tasks. Application security engineers partner with application developers and others throughout the SDLC to protect applications by diagnosing, documenting, and remediating application security vulnerabilities.
Typically in an organization, an application developer's main objective is to produce working code as quickly as possible to meet business requirements. As a result, writing secure code is sometimes an afterthought. This is where application security engineers can be super helpful by building security into the development process so that sensitive data remains protected. In doing so, they aim to ensure that an application provides what is commonly referred to as CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 
For example, application security engineers help developers design and deploy the application in a way that requires proper authentication (to protect the confidentiality of data), transfers sensitive information securely to prevent it from being modified (integrity), and ensures that users can access their data (availability). 
Application security engineers are often embedded within an application development team and serve as advisers to designers and developers. They ensure that application requirements include security considerations, they suggest secure authentication protocols during the design phase, they implement code reviews to check for common security vulnerabilities, they test applications before deployment, and they advise on the timing and methods for patching vulnerabilities.
In this unit, you learned what an application is and how application development and security functions work together in practice. In the next unit, you learn about the business impact of application security, the skills application security engineers need, and common application security scenarios.

Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Explain the impact of application security on business.
•	List the key skills needed to become an application security professional.
•	Describe common application security scenarios.
The Impact of Application Security on Businesses 
Inadequate application security can have huge negative consequences for an organization. Cyber intruders attack a variety of organizations every day in the hope of enriching themselves by extracting money, corporate information, and intellectual property. Attackers use the hijacked data to make unauthorized purchases and steal consumers’ identities. 
If you follow the news, you know that attackers have successfully compromised applications to access data stored in the computer systems of retailers, credit reporting companies, airlines, entertainment companies, government offices, schools, and many other organizations. In one case, a hotel chain was breached by a foreign country. In another case, a SQL injection attack, which we’ll cover later, installed spyware on a company’s computers which exposed customer credit card information. In multiple cases, intruders stole credit card data by taking advantage of weak data encryption systems. In total, these attacks exposed the personal information of hundreds of millions of customers.
These security breaches resulted in direct economic impacts from fraud and theft, but a security breach can also yield indirect economic impacts, like the loss of reputation. This can produce additional financial consequences on the business due to a loss of customers, reduced shareholder trust, and damaged brand image. Security breaches can also have legal and regulatory ramifications that result in fines and sanctions. 
Application security engineers have a critical role to play in ensuring that customer data is adequately protected by business applications. Because the role of an application security engineer is so important, they need to have a wide range of proficiencies. Let’s dig into this a bit more to see what skills an application security engineer needs.
Application Security Engineer Skills 
Imagine that you’re going to fly to a distant island for a tropical vacation. Before you board your airplane, you must pass through multiple airport security checkpoints. Security personnel check your ID and boarding pass, you walk through a metal detector, your luggage is X-Rayed, you pass airport security dogs, and security guards monitor TV screens to watch for unusual activity. These are layers of security at the airport to ensure that you enjoy a safe trip to your destination. Similar to the security personnel at an airport, an application security engineer must be aware of attacker entry points and provide the necessary safeguards against vulnerabilities at each phase of the application’s development and deployment.
 
Reports from security associations (ISC)² and Information Systems Security Association International (ISSA) discuss the cyber security skills shortage that has been growing for years. An increase in security incidents has led organizations to report an acute need for application security professionals to protect applications and data. In light of this and the fact that application security engineers require more training, an application security engineer can often earn more money than application developers.
Application security engineers employ various techniques at different stages of an application’s software development lifecycle (SDLC) to uncover security vulnerabilities. In order to do this, an application security engineer must have a good grasp of many technical skills, which include:
•	Threat modeling: Think about how attackers can compromise a system and what protections are needed against them
•	Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC): Help developers write secure code that minimizes vulnerabilities by implementing secure coding standards, techniques, and best practices
•	Security code reviews: Identify security vulnerabilities in source code before an application is deployed to production
•	Vulnerability testing and analysis: Discover weaknesses once an application is deployed and advise development teams on remediation
Since application security engineers work with various people (application developers, testers, designers, and others), they need to be good collaborators and communicators. They also need to be good writers since they generate documents that explain their technical findings. In some cases, they need to use their persuasive powers to convince management why a certain security feature should be installed before an application is deployed. Often, they must use their critical thinking skills to determine the various ways that an intruder would try to attack an application. Then they need to find creative solutions to thwart potential attacks. If an intrusion occurs, they investigate the incident to help identify the source of the compromise and harden the application against future attacks.
On top of the skills listed above, the following certifications can bolster an application security engineer’s knowledge.
•	GIAC Web Application Defender (GWEB)
•	Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP)
•	Secure Software Practitioner (SSP)
•	Certified Application Security Engineer (CASE)
•	Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation 
If you’re considering a career as an application security professional, earning a college degree in computer science is a good way to start on that path. Application security engineers will often start out as application developers and then transition into the cybersecurity field. Also, multiple colleges offer degrees in cybersecurity. It’s definitely an exciting field with many opportunities.
Now that you know about the skills you need to be an application security engineer, let's look at what common security scenarios an application security engineer encounters and how to protect applications in these situations.
Common Application Security Scenarios 
Cybercriminals look for the easiest access to steal, modify, or destroy data that requires the least amount of effort and provides the biggest payback. The more complex an application is, the higher the probability that it contains security vulnerabilities. Applications, especially web applications, are targets of cybercriminals because they present a large and relatively easily exploitable attack surface (the user interface) that can allow an intruder to access sensitive information stored on a computer. Also, intruders do not need any special tools to attack a web application. All they need is a computer and an Internet connection.
While attackers are trying to figure out how to infiltrate an application, application security engineers are focused on minimizing vulnerabilities in application code and ensuring application components are securely configured in order to prevent unauthorized access to customer accounts and data. A valuable resource to consult when reviewing applications security risks is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). OWASP is an international organization that provides freely available information focused on improving software security.
So, what are some common risks an application security engineer may encounter? An injection attack is a good example and occurs when there is improper sanitization of application inputs. In an injection attack, an intruder inserts code, instead of expected input data, into the applications input handling logic (the code that manages communication between an end user interface and a database). 
If the application is written incorrectly, the application will run the code that the attacker injects. For example, structured query language, known commonly as SQL, could be entered into an email address field on a web page. SQL is a language used in programming and is designed to manage data. If there is no check on the input field, an attacker might be able to extract information (like health records) from the application’s database by using the SQL code. 
To sanitize a user’s input, an application should ensure that the application handles user input as data instead of commands and includes only allowlisted characters (an allowlist is a list of characters that are granted access to a system). When an allowlist is used, all other entities are denied access, except those included in the allowlist, and those that don’t exceed the maximum data field lengths.
Other responsibilities of application security engineers are reviewing, testing, and verifying code during the development process to ensure user inputs are properly sanitized in order to help prevent against the injection attack described above. This is especially critical in the context of agile software development, which seeks to deliver application functionality faster than other development methods. But the agile method adds complexity because it requires continuous updating of applications to keep up with end-user expectations. Developers are expected to provide new features and fix discovered bugs at a rapid pace. Applications must be hardened to prevent exploits, and it's the application security engineer’s job to advise the development team on the most efficient way of doing so.
Weak, or nonexistent, encryption is another prevalent application security shortcoming that can allow attackers to expose sensitive data. Applications are vulnerable when they use protocols like HTTP that transmit data as clear text. Instead, applications should use secure protocols like HTTPS that encrypt data transmissions, so the data can’t be read without the proper decryption key. Old, weak encryption algorithms and internally developed encryption functions should be avoided. Instead, application security engineers should rely on secure, standards-based encryption algorithms.
Application security engineers help developers follow a Secure SDLC process. They adopt secure application design and architecture techniques based on well-known security practices, which include providing strong authentication and authorization and employing secure session management to prevent unauthorized access. 
Application security engineers deploy applications that prevent users from logging in with default credentials, since this is a common attack vector. They sanitize user input to hinder injection attacks. Some data breaches have succeeded due to weak encryption, so application security engineers use strong algorithms with appropriate encryption key management to encrypt data transmissions and stored data (data at rest). Then if attackers infiltrate the system, they can’t extract any useful information since they won’t know how to decrypt the data. 
Application security engineers ensure that errors are handled properly so that no sensitive information is released to the user. They also perform static and dynamic application security testing during and after application development and monitor the application for any unusual activity after deployment.
Sum It Up 
In this unit, we covered how an application security breach can impact a business, what skills application security engineers need, and explored common application security scenarios. Next, let’s discuss the first step every good application security engineer takes: identifying the applications in their environment, and their associated risks.

Understand Network Security 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe what a network is.
•	Identify ways people and assets access a network.
•	Explain network security engineering.
What Is a Network? 
A network is a fabric of interconnected elements that are related to each other. We encounter a variety of networks on a daily basis. Networks allow us to travel, to connect with other people, to view entertainment content, to collect and disburse information, and so much more. Similarly, a computer network connects two or more computers with various devices in order to share resources among people and other computers. Computer networks consist of many devices: servers, routers, computers, printers, scanners, and so on. We access computer networks to check social media, read email, review our bank account balance, and perform countless other functions.
In this module, we get to know Jim and Florence who are network security professionals. We learn about their job responsibilities, plus the skills they need and the tools they use to protect computer networks from potential security threats.
 
How People and Devices Access a Network 
Because we live in an interconnected world, it’s important to understand how computer network access works. It’s also imperative that we protect these networks since we rely on them every day. Let’s look at how encryption and authentication help to protect networks.
Some computer networks are public and some are private. A public computer network allows anybody to connect to it. You access a public computer network whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot at a coffee shop or inside an airport. A private computer network has restricted access. It allows only certain people and devices to connect to it. In this way, a private network regulates who and what can access its resources. Businesses operate private networks that allow their employees to communicate with each other and access internal, company-related information.
Since we don’t want just anybody to access our personal information, like our bank account balance, websites use authentication and encryption to protect network access and data transfers. To check your account balance, your bank requires that you prove who you are—this is authentication.
Encryption converts data from standard text into coded data that is not humanly readable. This ensures that nobody else can retrieve your private data that is being transmitted across a public computer network. Websites use encryption to protect the information that’s passed between your device, for example, your cell phone and your bank. Many websites use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to encrypt data. 
Now let’s check in with Florence. She’s a network security engineer at a large bank that serves customers in multiple countries. Part of Florence’s job is to ensure that only an authorized account holder can access his or her account. Her bank adopted an authentication process that requires the account holder to provide a username and password, or a debit card and a PIN (personal identification number), to log in to their account.
Florence also implemented multi-factor authentication, known as MFA. To access their account with MFA, a customer provides their username/password and is then required to verify their identity with an additional authentication factor, such as an authenticator app or security key. MFA provides an added layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access to bank accounts.
Understand Network Security 
We expect computer networks to be available and secure 24 hours a day so we can access them whenever and wherever we want. When computer networks are unavailable, it affects how we conduct our daily lives. If your bank’s computer system is unavailable, you may be unable to pay your bills (ouch!) or transfer funds to the appropriate account.
Because of the massive amount of personal, health, financial, and other data stored on computer networks, securing public and private computer networks is essential. As a result, network security professionals build multiple layers of security into their computer systems to provide what is commonly referred to as CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Many types of people may try to gain unauthorized access to a computer network. These range from hackers who want to gain access for fun or fame, to cybercriminals who want to steal money and information, to cyberterrorists who want to disrupt and damage.
As a network security engineer at a medical clinic, Jim knows health records are a prime target for cybercriminals. Any security breach can have legal and regulatory ramifications resulting in fines and sanctions. To minimize those risks, Jim uses hardware and software tools that provide added layers of protection for patients.
While Jim is aware that external cybercriminals want to attack his systems, he knows that threats can also arise internally from intentional and unintentional actions by employees or other authorized users. This can arise from a malicious insider (like a disgruntled employee) or accidental deletion by an uninformed user. Because of this, it’s critical that he knows his system configuration and typical usage patterns so he can recognize potential security threats. In many cases, internal attacks are often accidental occurrences, so the best way to deal with them is through cybersecurity education and awareness for all employees.
 
In the end, it’s the network security professional’s job to ensure a computer system’s CIA by keeping out unwanted intruders while providing authorized access to those who need it. Network security professionals are not always the most popular people in an organization because the security measures that they employ can make network access a bit of a challenge. Think of their job as being similar to a stadium ticket taker. This person causes a slowdown in the stadium entry process that can result in ticket holders having to wait in line. But the ticket takers fill an important role by ensuring that each person who enters the stadium has a valid ticket.

Describe the Healthcare Technology Landscape 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Describe the healthcare technology landscape. 
•	Identify the main goals of healthcare industry organizations. 
•	Define key healthcare technologies. 
•	Define key cybersecurity terms used in the healthcare industry. 
What Is Healthcare Technology?
Most people use healthcare technology (healthtech) every day even if they don’t know it. From wearable devices such as smartwatches that track heart rate to the Internet of Things (IoT) to track insulin levels in diabetes patients, healthtech’s use is widespread and continues to grow at a rapid pace. But what is healthtech and why is it important? 
Healthtech is the use of technologies developed for the purpose of improving all aspects of healthcare. These technologies include digital devices, software, and tools designed to support healthcare organizations, doctors, and patients, with the goal of enabling people to access, exchange, and manage healthcare information electronically.  
 
Healthtech improves patients’ quality of care by increasing the productivity and efficiency of hospitals and other healthcare organizations. By turning over recurring and monotonous tasks to powerful computers, the technology lessens the burden on healthcare professionals and allows them to focus their goals on improving healthcare for all. 
Goals of Healthcare Organizations
When it comes to quality healthcare, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. In fact, personalization and customization are key as no two people are alike. Tailoring everything from medication to exercise regimens amplifies human health. Healthtech is such a transformative practice that its impacts are causing a lasting change across the globe. 
In general, healthtech aims to: 
•	Improve the patient experience. 
•	Improve people’s health. 
•	Reduce the per-person cost of healthcare. 
Healthtech supports these aims by expanding options for medical treatments while transforming how medical professionals execute their jobs. It also provides patients with tools for managing their health independently and together with their healthcare practitioners. 
As an enabler of the medical profession principle, “First, do no harm,” healthtech introduces new technologies that, when properly secured, increase patient health by reducing medication errors and improving compliance. For example, pharmacists can use healthtech to improve patient safety by identifying prescription drug conflicts through data correlation of a patient’s allergies with prescribed medications. Healthcare practitioners can use healthtech to access and update patient health records and exchange patient care data with colleagues rapidly for collaboration efforts, secondary opinions, and evaluations. 
Key Healthcare Technologies
Healthtech is already becoming integrated into every fabric of the healthcare industry from administrative processes to cancer research and drug development. Healthcare practitioners can leverage these technologies to make the patient experience as painless as possible while improving overall human health. Let’s take a closer look at some healthtech applications in the areas of administrative processes, drug development, surgery, IoT, and telehealth. 
Administrative Technologies 
Administrative technologies allow hospitals and healthcare organizations to manage their growing administrative workloads and tasks such as scheduling and documenting patient care. Let’s look at a few of these technologies. 
•	Artificial intelligence (AI) streamlines patient workflows by calculating wait times and predicting peak busy hours thus enabling improved scheduling and prioritization of appointments. 
•	Electronic medical records (EMR) emulate a patient’s paper chart and contain the patient’s medical and treatment history from one medical practice into a digital version. 
•	Electronic health records (EHR) contain the totality of a patient’s health record, consist of the patient’s EMR from multiple doctors, and represent a long-term view of a patient's health in digital form. 
Drug Development Technologies 
The pharmaceutical industry leans heavily on AI and machine learning (ML) to power a new wave of drug research and development by automating manual tasks such as combining certain chemicals to create the optimal drug. 
Surgical Technologies 
Surgical and recovery times are drastically reduced thanks to numerous technologies. Let’s look at a few common applications. 
•	Robotics removes the dependence of solely onsite doctors for care. Robotic surgical assistants are often used in tandem with an onsite doctor to perform processes from non-invasive procedures to open-heart surgery. 
•	Virtual reality (VR) allows aspiring surgeons the use of augmented VR (a real-life view of an experience projected onto a screen) to gain experience on conducting several different types of surgeries or practicing new surgical techniques. 
•	Three-dimensional (3D) printing increases the number of available organs for transplants. 3D printing is changing the world of organ transplants by allowing for the substitution of certain organs and artificial tissue with 3D printed solutions to replace or repair damage or structures in the body. 
IoT Technologies 
IoT consists of a network of internet-connected objects able to collect and exchange data. The technology offers new opportunities for healthcare professionals to monitor patients, as well as patients to monitor themselves. Some examples of these health monitoring devices include connected inhalers and glucose monitoring. 
•	Connected inhalers help treat conditions such as asthma by monitoring a patient's frequency of attacks and collecting environmental data for their healthcare provider to understand what triggered the attack. These inhalers also alert patients if they leave inhalers at home or when they use the inhaler improperly. 
•	Glucose monitoring in diabetic patients has traditionally been difficult. Patient's have to manually check and record their glucose regularly often at inconvenient times. These checks typically represent a snapshot in time. IoT devices for glucose monitoring provide continuous, automatic monitoring of glucose levels and eliminate the need for manual record keeping, while alerting patients when their glucose levels are problematic. 
Remote Patient Monitoring and Telehealth  
These are probably the most common applications of healthcare IoT devices. These devices automatically collect health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, or temperature from implanted or wearable medical devices from patients not physically present in a healthcare facility. Software applications manage, save, and forward the collected data to a medical professional anywhere in the world where an internet connection and access to the application exist. 
 
Healthcare Cybersecurity Terminology
With all these advancements in healthtech, cybersecurity has become more vital than ever for the healthcare sector. Yet cybersecurity threats to the healthcare industry are rapidly on the rise. Financially motivated criminal organizations and other threat actors continue to target the healthcare industry with ransomware attacks and data theft, which puts patient safety and privacy at risk. It’s therefore critical to view cybersecurity as a patient safety issue, enterprise risk, and strategic priority. Before we dive a bit deeper into these threats and risks, let’s learn about a few cybersecurity related terms the healthcare industry uses. 
Term 	Definition 
Protected health information (PHI) 	The demographic information, medical histories, test and laboratory results, insurance information, and other data that a healthcare professional collects to identify an individual and determine appropriate care 
Healthcare breach 	The unauthorized access of PHI 
Ransomware 	A malware attack that targets critical business systems; encrypts files, servers, and databases; and demands a ransom to unencrypt them and restore access 
Medical device hacking (Medhacking) 	The practice of manipulating or disrupting a network-enabled medical device with the intent to gain unauthorized access to the device or data it stores. 
Medical device hijacking (Medjacking) 	A more malicious form of medhacking where cybercriminals hijack medical devices to take control of the device’s functions and manipulate its operation to cause harm to the patient, disrupt healthcare operations or other malicious purposes. 
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) 	An authentication method requiring two or more verification factors to access a resource 
Denial of service (DoS) 	An attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users 
Data loss prevention (DLP) 	Software that detects and prevents potential data breaches/data exfiltration attempts by monitoring, detecting, and blocking sensitive data while in use, in motion, and at rest 
Patching 	A modification to a software program to improve or fix its security or performance 
Encryption 	The process of converting data to an unrecognizable or “encrypted” form 
Supply chain risk management 	The process of focusing on the risk management of external suppliers, vendors, logistics, and transportation

Get to Know the Energy and Utilities Industries 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Describe the energy and utilities industry. 
•	Discuss the current energy and utilities industry outlook. 
The Energy Industry at a Glance
Before the industrial revolution, our energy needs were modest. For heat, we relied on the sun, or we burned wood and straw. For transportation, horses gave us mobility, and wind in our sails helped us explore the world. 
For a hundred years, energy consumers had one option for service. Utility companies didn’t have to compete for customers, and customers couldn’t shop around for utility services. Utilities offered one service, electricity, and everyone wanted it. 
Today, many customers have different options, including the type and source of energy they buy, and whom they buy it from. They can shop for rates and energy-efficient appliance rebates to suit their energy needs. 
In a deregulated market, customers enjoy greater freedom in shopping for utility services, because deregulation increases competition, and competition multiplies customer choice. This means multiple utility companies compete to provide better services to customers. As they say, competition in a market is always good for customers. 
Add customer demand to this. Today’s customer expects to engage their utility provider for other reasons, not just to report outages to the call center. Customers now want digital services such as: 
•	Status updates through social media 
•	Online bill payment 
•	Incentives and offers over self-service mobile channels 
In fact, customers want to be informed through all available communication channels, such as text, email, and social media. 
They no longer depend solely on utilities for their energy needs, because they can get their energy from non-utility companies too. For instance, some tech and automobile companies are also offering utility services to consumers like never before. 
Consumers can also generate electricity themselves by using solar panels and wind turbines. So, utilities aren’t only competing with non-utility companies but also customers to own the energy-customer relationship. 
Most of the earth’s population relies on electricity, gas, and water supply. For this reason, the opportunities to serve billions of customers with better and faster services are endless. 
Energy and Utilities Industry Outlook
The global energy and utilities industry includes three major categories of natural resources: electricity, natural gas, and water. The industry is responsible for the safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable generation, transmission, and distribution of these resources. The key industry segments are: 
•	Generation 
•	Transmission and distribution 
•	Customer or retail 
•	Water distribution 
•	Natural gas transmission and distribution 
 
A value chain is the complete set of activities starting from energy generation, transmission, marketing, and finally distribution to retailers and customers. An efficient value chain creates economic value for customers, employees, and society at large. 
You need a robust distribution network to guarantee a stable supply of energy to customers. Energy production, marketing, and promotion are activities that are now open to competition. However, power distribution is still a cost-managed monopoly business in most parts of the world. Government-owned entities usually manage the power distribution business, which has a slightly different value chain compared to the privately managed ones. 
Renewable energy has been gaining momentum in the electricity industry as the infrastructure and logistics for generating electricity from renewable sources become cheaper and more accessible. Renewable energy uses naturally replenished sources, such as the sun, wind, water, the earth’s heat, and plants. Renewable energy plays an important role in the world’s energy security and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
The energy and utilities industry faces several challenges, such as: 
•	New and more stringent regulations 
•	Nuclear vulnerability in some countries 
•	Security-related issues around the transport of raw materials 
To grow in these conditions, companies must digitally transform, reorganize, and change their action plans. This means investing in new technologies and methodologies, including information analytics. 
Key Industry Terms

Explore Types of Utility, Energy, and Waste Companies 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Identify the different types of utilities. 
•	Describe the types of utility, energy, and waste companies. 
Utilities Basics
Take a look at the three types of utility products and how utility companies work to produce the products and transport them to customers. 
Electricity
Electricity starts with generation. Traditional power generators are utilities that produce electricity from fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy sources. 
This image shows the electricity production and distribution process. 
 
After power is generated, it’s often transformed from low to high voltage, so that transmission lines can efficiently carry it over long distances. When power nears its final destination, distribution transformers convert high-voltage power back to low voltage and deliver it to customers at end usage points. Some large commercial and industrial customers draw power directly from transmission lines. 
In some markets, customers create their own power using distributed energy resources (DER) systems. DERs are small-scale power generation or storage systems located close to where the electricity is used, such as in a home or business. 
Energy retailers, also called vertically integrated utilities depending on the market, sell electricity to customers. Some customers generate and store their electricity on-site with photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, electric vehicles (EV), and microgrids. They can also sell their energy back to utilities. 
Gas
Natural gas is a nonrenewable hydrocarbon gas used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. The natural gas production journey involves several complex stages. First, companies extract fossil fuels and biofuels. Next, they process the fuels using odorification, compression, metering, and finally liquefaction. Lastly, companies sell the processed gas to the commodity market. 
This image shows the production and distribution process of natural gas.
 
Transmission networks move high-pressure gas to large industrial customers, gas-powered electricity generators, or storage. Storage facilities hold the gas reserves. 
Distribution companies receive gas from transmission companies and deliver it to their customers. Depending on the market, distribution companies sometimes operate as a regulated monopoly or a competitive retail company. In a competitive gas market, retailers and gas suppliers sometimes purchase gas from the distributors and pay them to ship it to the customer's premises. 
Water
In this image, observe how water is sourced and distributed to customers. The image also shows how utilities collect wastewater from customers and send it for treatment. 
 
Utilities source water from rivers and reservoirs, water-treatment plants, and service reservoirs by abstraction and treatment. They store the treated water in storage facilities before transporting it to customers. 
Similar to gas, in a deregulated water market, a retailer or utility company purchases water from the distributor and pays them to ship it through a clean water network for household or commercial consumption. The retailer has contracts with the customer and is responsible for billing water consumption and waste discharge. Wastewater is sent back into the system through a wastewater network for treatment and storage at sewage or sludge-treatment facilities. 
Types of Utility, Energy, and Waste Companies
Now that you know more about how utilities function, examine the players that serve the utility service needs of customers. This section focuses on the electricity industry, but the gas and water industries have similar counterparts. 
Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Companies
Power generation, transmission, and distribution companies specialize in creating, transmitting, and distributing energy and utilities. 
 
Power generation companies generate electric power from primary sources of energy, such as solar, wind, nuclear, coal, oil, and natural gas. For utilities in the electric power industry, power generation is the stage before storage or delivery to customers through transmission, distribution, and so forth. 
Transmission companies specialize in the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site to an electrical substation. At this point, distribution companies take over using interconnected lines known as a transmission network. The combined transmission and distribution network is commonly known as the Grid in North America and the National Grid in the United Kingdom, India, Tanzania, Myanmar, Malaysia, and New Zealand. Transmission companies are often combined with or serve as distribution companies. 
Distribution companies deliver electric power by carrying electricity from the transmission system to individual customers. Distribution substations connect to the high-voltage transmission system and use transformers to lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV. 
Electric Suppliers and Retailers
Electric suppliers and retailers are companies that buy electricity from the commodity market and sell it to customers. In many countries, the electricity market has been deregulated to open up the supply of electricity to competition. The role of electricity retailing has changed from administrative in integrated utilities to revenue-generation and risk-management in today’s competitive electricity market. 
Electricity retailers now offer their customers fixed or variable prices for electricity and manage the risk involved in purchasing electricity from spot markets or electricity pools. In a deregulated market, also called a competitive or liberalized energy market, customers can: 
•	Choose from several competing electricity suppliers. 
•	Purchase electricity sourced from renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar. 
•	Buy other related products and services. 
Electric Cooperatives
Electric cooperatives (co-ops), are private, nonprofit utility businesses owned by the customers they serve. Co-ops provide at-cost electric service and are governed by an elected board of directors. The two types of cooperatives include distribution cooperatives and generation and transmission (G&T) cooperatives. 
•	Distribution cooperatives deliver electricity to their member-owners. 
•	G&Ts provide wholesale power to distribution co-ops through their own generation or by purchasing power on behalf of the distribution members. 
Co-ops are typically established in rural areas that don’t have an investor-owned or municipal utility nearby to supply electric power. Examples of electric cooperatives include Great Lakes Energy Cooperative in Michigan and Dixie Power in Utah. 
Energy Services Companies
Energy services companies (ESCOs) design, develop, build, and arrange financing for projects that save energy, reduce energy costs, and decrease operations and maintenance costs at their customers’ facilities. In general, ESCOs act as project developers for a comprehensive range of energy conservation measures (ECMs) and assume the technical and performance risks associated with a project. 
Investor-Owned Utilities
Investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are privately owned electricity and natural gas providers that aim to produce a return for investors. IOUs distribute profits to stockholders or reinvest the profits. A public utilities commission regulates and sets the rate with some customer participation. IOUs purchase power through contracts and also have their own generation facilities. They’re the largest type of electric utility and have a complex mix of customers. Examples of IOUs include FirstEnergy in Ohio and Pacific Gas & Electric in California. 
Public Utilities
Public or municipality-owned utilities are nonprofit local government agencies. They provide services to communities that recover costs and earn additional returns. Public utilities use the returns to invest in new facilities. Locally elected officials or public employees manage public utilities. 
Public utilities can return excess funds to customers through reduced rates, community contributions, and increased operational efficiencies. The utility governing body or city council sets the rates. Public utilities operate their own generation facilities or buy power through contracts. Examples of public utilities include Breckenridge Public Utilities in Minnesota and Burlington Electric Department in Vermont. 
Summary
In this unit, you learned about the different types of utility products and how utility companies produce and distribute their products. You also got to know that many types of utility companies operate worldwide, including investor-owned, municipality-owned, and cooperatives. These companies strive to meet the energy, gas, water, and waste needs of communities. 
In the next unit, you learn how these companies operate within their markets.

Discover Market Models and Their Impact on Utilities 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Explain the different types of global utility market models. 
•	Discuss the challenges that utilities face today. 
•	Describe the impact of processes required by key business units. 
Types of Global Utility Market Models
Energy markets across the world are in the middle of a revolution, triggered by decarbonization and fueled by innovation. Some countries have introduced energy deregulation and competition into energy markets, which has led to the creation of new types of energy markets. Here’s a look at some of the globally recognized energy market models. 
Regulated
 
Utility companies in regulated markets, often called vertically integrated utilities, must show a return on investment or a benefit for the money they spend. In a regulated market, the utility companies own the infrastructure, which includes electric transmission lines and all the associated equipment, such as power poles, power lines, and transformers. These utility companies often generate or purchase electricity and sell it to customers. 
Regulated with Competition
 
Utilities in a regulated competitive market are similar to regulated utilities, but they face some level of energy supplier competition. This type of market model often caters to the customer base with higher usage or demand. 
Some regulated markets support a level of energy supplier competition. Utilities in regulated markets are often considered vertically integrated, which means they have a monopoly over the sale of power to their customers. But in many regions, utilities offer limited choices for some customer segments. Examples of such regions in the US include California, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, and Virginia. 
Sometimes residential customers buy power from the community or renewable-energy suppliers. In many cases, commercial and industrial (C&I) customers with high usage and demand buy power from energy suppliers that can meet their operational budgets and sustainability goals with clean energy. 
Transitioning
 
Transitioning markets are now open to full-scale competition. However, these markets haven’t fully separated or unbundled all of the existing entities of the previously regulated market. Entities include generation, transmission, distribution, and retail. 
Competitive
 
Competitive markets are also known as deregulated energy markets. In a competitive market, utility companies own and maintain the transmission infrastructure and distribute electricity, while other companies compete to supply and sell electricity and gas to customers. 
In a deregulated market, vertically integrated companies are split into multiple independent companies that focus on a specific aspect of the market. For example, a single vertically integrated utility company is split into generation, transmission and distribution, and energy supply companies, though this varies between markets. Additionally, services such as meter asset management and meter ownership are sometimes split into separate companies. 
The goals of energy deregulation typically include breaking up monopolies and encouraging energy supplier competition. This gives customers more options and encourages price competition. A successful deregulated market has some churn because customers mostly shop for competitive rates and offers that fit their needs and lifestyles. 
Challenges Facing Utilities
The energy and utilities industries face many obstacles due to the current business environment. Consolidation is creating an increasing need to integrate, merge, and reconcile business-support systems. Here’s an overview of the industry environment and the challenges it presents. 
Deregulation
Around the world, countries have introduced energy deregulation and competition into energy markets to democratize the energy and utilities industry and provide customers with choices. The more competitive a market, the more pressure on utilities to gain and retain customers. 
Deregulation: 
•	Increases customer choice and energy supplier competition to encourage competitive energy pricing. 
•	Unbundles generation, transmission, distribution, supply, and customer service. 
•	Helps break up monopolies over the end-to-end elements of electricity, gas, and water supply. 
Aging Infrastructure and Workforce
Along with competitive pressure, the energy and utilities sector is at an inflection point. Aging infrastructure needs replacement, and a new generation is entering the workforce. In addition to the physical infrastructure, aging and inflexible customer information systems (CIS) and billing systems can no longer handle the data and security requirements of changing markets. 
Retail Competition’s Effect on Energy Rates
Competitive markets lead to price competition, and the commercial and industrial segments benefit the most. Even customers using default services provided by utilities in competitive regions still benefit from competitive markets, because competition leads to more choices. 
Climate Change and Environmental Responsibility
Everybody's talking about climate change. The implementation of energy savings and efficiency measures, and the use of renewable energies, are constantly increasing. That’s why utility companies must rethink their strategies and shift their operations to reach greater levels of environmental stewardship and protection. When it comes to finding new ways to generate energy through sustainable processes, it’s now or never. 
Furthermore, energy sustainability measures open the door to major economic benefits. Sustainability measures can help generate mass amounts of information with valuable consumption and generation data to bring down costs. 
Digital Transformation
Digital adoption and rapid technological change are forcing utilities to rethink their current business models, including how they work and the services they provide. To achieve greater sustainability and higher energy savings, utilities have to implement digitization strategies that facilitate the design, implementation, and operation of new sustainable technologies in which customers play a starring role. 
Customers expect to have a more fluid and personalized experience. What’s more, they want more information, with detailed data on their rates and consumption. Utilities must make their strategies customer-centric and digitize their processes and tools.
Key Business Units and Processes
The rules of the energy industry are changing as utilities embrace new technologies and customers gain more control over products. Examine some of the impacts of changes to business processes on customers and key business units. 
 
Accounting Rules Changes: Information Services
Often, utilities in regulated markets are unable to capitalize on the money they spend on services in the same way that they can for capital equipment. Because regulated markets lack competition, utilities haven’t prioritized information services, such as cloud-computing solutions to support their business processes. However, this is changing as some utilities acknowledge the benefits provided by software as a service (SaaS). 
Utility Rules Changes: Who Creates Energy?
Now customers really do have power, their own power. With rooftop solar, electric vehicles, batteries, and microgrids, customers can sell their power back to the grid. They can also get paid by utilities to reduce their consumption or use stored energy when grid capacity is strained. 
Distributed energy resources are a consideration and even a concern for grid operators who fear the impact of losing customers. But, if utilities and customers are aligned, distributed energy resources can work to the advantage of both utilities and customers to: 
•	Regulate the flow of electricity. 
•	Transition to cleaner energy. 
•	Keep the grid safe and secure. 
•	Reduce energy costs. 
Grid Changes: Moving to Multidirectional
Grid evolution is driving the need for cloud platforms because as the energy grid becomes more distributed and multidirectional, the enterprise platforms required to manage this flow of data and transactions must adapt. 
In the past, power flowed one way, and the system was focused on safe, reliable, and affordable power. New and disruptive innovations, such as distributed energy resources, are changing this. Power now flows two ways. Energy can be mobile and the computing needs to manage everything are far greater. New digital energy cloud platforms, such as Salesforce, are filling that need. 
Summary
In this unit, you learned about the various utility market models. You also learned about the challenges faced by utilities and the impact of industry transformation on business units and processes. 
In the next unit, you learn about the common utility services and the key energy units of measure.

Learn Common Utility Processes, Services, and Units of Measure 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Explain the common utility service processes. 
•	Describe the common customer notifications. 
•	Describe the energy and utilities units of measure. 
•	Define the pricing and quoting terms for various energy and utility commodities. 
Common Energy and Utilities Service Processes
Apart from delivering energy products to customers, utilities also provide additional services to make customers’ service experience better. Here are the most common energy and utilities service processes for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) customers. 
 
Manage Communication Preferences and Services
With so many channels of communication available, good customer service tailors the communication method to customer preferences. Whether it’s incoming or outgoing communications, utilities must manage their customer communications efficiently so that customers get what they need in a way that’s convenient for them. 
People and businesses move and change. Customer service agents communicate regularly with individuals who are moving to a different house and need their service changed. Agents also work with businesses that plan to move to a different location. 
Customers who own multiple properties need to organize their utilities efficiently. Easy access to real-time information and customer service are important to property managers. 
New Programs and Energy Services
New programs and energy services are exciting topics for many customers and a chance for companies to build relationships. They share information with customers about new programs, such as solar, electric vehicles, batteries, and related offers and rebates. 
Bill Inquiry and Payment Assistance
Customers sometimes call to ask questions about their bill or to submit a meter reading, but this need not be the end of the conversation. With the right tools, customer service agents can use this time to build a relationship with the customer. This includes suggesting ways for the customer to save or manage energy, which can help them save money. 
Customer service agents also reach out to customers about payments and sometimes about nonpayment of bills. This can lead to conversations about payment and collections assistance. 
Service Outage, Safety, and Service Callout
Service outage and safety issue notifications are two-way communications. Customers can report a service outage or safety issue, and utilities can communicate a planned or unplanned service outage or safety issue to customers through several channels. 
When an equipment malfunctions, companies dispatch workers to the site to make repairs. Service can be planned or unplanned, and utilities inform the customers about any potential outages and expected restoration times. 
New Rates and Construction
Whether fixed or variable, rates change from time to time. New rates and rate changes are sometimes available by choice or mandate. Customer service agents regularly reach out to customers about changes and rate choices through calls and digital channels. 
A lot goes on at new construction sites and not just for the general contractor. Utilities carry out many different actions at new construction sites, which they manage on a schedule to avoid disruptions in construction. 
Common Customer Notifications
Now that you know the various common customer service tasks, it’s time to learn more about the common customer notifications. 
 
Account Activation and Deactivation Services
Customers sometimes move in and out of a utility’s service area, and they occasionally switch to a competitor as well. With current trends, it’s more common than ever for customers to contact their utilities to add, switch, and deactivate service. 
Welcome Communications
When a new customer joins a utility service, it’s important to start the customer relationship with a communication to welcome them onboard. Examples include welcome calls, gifts, and emails. 
Electronic Fund Transfer Confirmations
With identity theft on the rise, many customers are setting up regular notifications through their banks. Offering customers the option to set up electronic funds transfer (EFT) confirmations with the utilities helps build customer trust. 
Payment Reminders and Overdue Notices
With busy schedules, sometimes customers overlook or forget to pay their bills. They like reminders to help them avoid additional fees and hits to their credit scores. 
Rate Change Notifications and Tariff Notices
While this type of notification is sometimes mandated, utility customers on variable rates run their businesses to maximize output and minimize costs. So, it’s important to know the rates at all times. Some rates vary in price by time of day or usage, and customers want to know when they cross a threshold into a higher rate or price. 
Outage or Restoration Notifications
Regardless of whether you service individual customers or businesses, it’s important for everyone experiencing an outage to know when repairs are underway and when service is restored. Often, outage notices include an estimated time of restoration. 
Crew Mobilization Notices
Whenever there’s a service disruption, it’s important to notify customers. Companies must also notify all crew members to mobilize and restore service. Mobilization notices alert crews when they must repair damage or perform services. 
Customer Satisfaction Surveys
As with any type of customer, utility customers don’t always share when they’re unhappy. So, it’s important to reach out to customers occasionally, to determine their level of satisfaction and improvement areas. 
Energy Product Measurements
Guess what utility companies do before selling their commodities? If you said measure and price their products, you get a gold star. Learn about some of the primary energy units of measure and pricing terms. 
 
Electricity Units of Measure
An energy unit used for electrical power, particularly for utility bills, is the kilowatt-hour (kWh), with one kilowatt-hour equivalent to 3.6 megajoules. Electricity usage is measured in units of kilowatt-hours per year or another time period. This is a measurement of average power consumption, meaning the average rate at which energy is transferred. One kilowatt-hour per year is about 0.11 watts. 
Natural Gas Units of Measure
Natural gas is often sold in units of energy content or by volume. The most commonly used units of measure for gas are gas cubic feet or meters. Ccf or one hundred cubic feet and Mcf or one thousand cubic feet are used to measure large volumes of natural gas. 
Water, Wastewater, and Waste Units of Measure
Water and wastewater are measured in gallons, cubic feet or meters, or centum cubic feet (CCF). Waste charges can be measured by weight or volume in skips, bins, dumpsters, or other containers, depending on the content of the waste. 
Energy and Utilities Pricing and Quoting Terms
Energy and utility companies employ usage pricing extensively. The four subtypes of pricing include unit rate, standing charge, interval pricing, and Flex pricing. 
Summary
In this unit, you learned how utilities communicate with their customers and how customer expectations are changing rapidly. You got to know about some of the common notifications that utilities send to their customers. In the end, you also learned about the various energy units of measure and pricing terms. 
In the next unit, you learn about the transformative shifts in the energy market and the impact of distributed energy resources and demand-side management.

Explore Market Pressures and Transformative Shifts 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Define the four Ds of energy transformation. 
•	Explain the factors driving digital transformation for energy and utility companies. 
•	Describe the impact of distributed energy resources and demand-side management on the energy market. 
The Four Ds of Energy Transformation
Transformative shifts are taking place in the energy and utilities industries, including deregulation, decentralization, and distributed energy resources (DER). Moreover, decarbonization, digitalization, and demand-side management are intensifying the shift. Energy transformation is defined by four Ds: decarbonization, deregulation, digitalization, and decentralization. Here’s a closer look at each of these processes. 
Decarbonization
 
Decarbonization is the move to cleaner energy and conservation behavior. This move changes the technologies used to generate power, such as wind and solar. In turn, the changes impact the infrastructure of the business as well as the products available to customers. Types of products resulting from decarbonization include green energy and renewable-based products. As a result, these changes affect customer-facing sales and service opportunities. 
Deregulation
 
Deregulated markets are moving away from verticalized utilities. Thanks to this shift, new market models are emerging in which nontraditional energy companies can now own the energy-customer relationship. As a result, traditional utility companies need new products and systems to support existing products and compete successfully. This means increased demands on their systems. 
Digitalization
 
Digitalization includes using the cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data to build smarter, more responsive grids, with an additional focus on customer behavior. Customers are now used to the sophisticated digital services offered in other industries and expect the same from their utility companies. You learn more about digital transformation later in this unit. 
Decentralization
 
With more on-site customer generation and distributed energy resources, such as solar power, EVs, microgrids, and battery storage, customers have more choice and power over the grid than ever. While this seems positive for customers, it places a new and increased burden on keeping a utility’s infrastructure safe, as the utility no longer owns, maintains, or physically controls all the energy resources that are now part of its energy grid. 
What’s Driving Digital Transformation?
As the energy industry evolves, customer expectations and utility innovations become increasingly varied. Take a look at some of the questions utilities ask as they try to meet the demands of the new-age energy industry. 
Customer Expectations and Value
As a utility company, how do I keep up? How do I personalize my products and communications for my vastly diverse customer base? How do I meet the customers where they want to be and anticipate their needs? How do I provide true value to my customers? 
Digital-First, Work-from-Anywhere, Real-Time
How do I deliver a digital-first experience for my customers and employees, connecting them from anywhere? Can I be agile enough? Can I generate insights and enable actions in real time that are valuable to my customers and that support our business objectives? 
Disruptive Regulatory and Technology Change
How will the industry landscape look in a competitive market, with new distributed, democratized, and decarbonized energy programs? How do I use IoT, smart devices, meters, and VPPs or networks to maximize grid, customer, and business value? What’s my place in new energy market models? 
Salesforce solutions support all types of utility market models across the globe and are flexible enough to meet the different expectations and innovations of each market. 
Impact of Distributed Energy Resources
DERs are electrical generation and storage facilities that consist of a variety of small, grid-connected, or distribution-system-connected devices. Distributed generation and storage enable the collection of energy from many sources, lower environmental impacts, and improve the security of supply. 
 
Conventional power stations, such as coal-fired and gas stations, nuclear-powered plants, hydroelectric dams, and large-scale solar power stations, are centralized and often transmit electric energy over long distances. 
In contrast to conventional power stations, DER systems are decentralized, modular, and use flexible technologies that are located close to the load they serve. However, DERs have capacities of only 10 megawatts (MW) or less. Multiple generation and storage components can form these systems, which are sometimes referred to as hybrid power systems. 
DER systems typically use renewable energy sources, such as hydro, biomass, biogas, sun, wind, and geothermal. DERs play an important role in the electric power distribution system as the energy industry moves towards renewable energy. 
Grid-Connected Devices
A grid-connected device for electricity storage can also be classified as a DER system and is called a distributed energy storage system (DESS). DER systems can be managed and coordinated in a smart grid through an interface. 
Microgrids
Microgrids are modern, localized, small-scale grids, as opposed to the traditional, centralized electricity grid or macrogrid. DERs can be the components of a microgrid. Think of a microgrid as a small, standalone grid, capable of meeting the energy needs of a defined area, such as a community or an area of several city blocks. To be self-sufficient in the provision of energy, a microgrid needs one or more sources of energy. 
In the past, a microgrid has included resources such as a diesel generator, but with technological advances, resources now include DERs, such as solar or wind. On a larger scale, microgrids also add efficient batteries to the mix to store energy. 
Microgrids can disconnect from the centralized grid and operate autonomously, strengthen grid resilience, and help mitigate grid disturbances. They’re typically low-voltage AC grids that use diesel generators and are installed by the community they serve. Microgrids nowadays employ a mixture of different DERs, such as solar hybrid power systems, which significantly reduce carbon emissions. 
Impact of Demand-Side Management
Demand-side management (DSM) is a group of actions designed to efficiently manage a site’s energy consumption to cut the costs incurred for the supply of electrical energy. Costs arise from grid charges and general system charges, including taxes. 
One way utilities can meet the demand on the grid is to reduce demand from the customer side by influencing customer consumption. The energy you save is measured in negawatts. No, it's not a joke. A negawatt is a hypothetical unit of power for measuring the amount of energy saved due to efficient energy consumption. A negawatt is the cheapest electron because it’s the one you don't use. 
Utilities use conservation or energy-efficiency programs to help customers commit to using little or no energy during certain peak times, which allows the utility company to keep reserve power plants shut down. Without these programs, utilities often fire up reserve plants to meet customer demand. For instance, when all of the air conditioners switch on at the same time in a Los Angeles heat wave. 
DSM optimization aims to achieve savings in electricity charges by modifying features of electricity consumption related to the: 
•	Overall consumption picture 
•	Consumption time profile 
•	Contractual supply parameters, including contractual power and grid connection parameters 
As a result of the high penetration of renewable sources and the decentralization of production sources, grid managers in many countries now see increased instability on the grid and consequent disruptions to services. 
Grid Services
Grid managers can use generation and consumption systems that offer grid services to limit the impact of service disruptions and ensure a balance between energy consumption and the amount of power fed into the grid. To engage in demand-side management, the first requirement is to carry out an in-depth analysis of onsite consumption. This involves assessing the unique requirements of each site and whether utilities can optimize the consumption habits of customers. 
Whenever a change in habit is unfeasible or simply insufficient to achieve the desired cost reductions, utilities can evaluate these on-site installation elements.

Time to Get Fluent in AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a dream of many storytellers and sci-fi fans for years. But for a long time most people hadn’t given AI much serious thought because it was always something that might happen far into the future. Well, researchers and computer scientists haven’t been waiting for tomorrow to arrive, they’ve been working hard to make the dream of AI into a reality. In fact, some have said we’ve already entered the Age of AI.

The first uses the prompt, “A closeup of a person sitting at a typewriter, drawn in the style of fun 2D vector artwork.” The second uses the prompt, “The scene is in a university classroom, there’s a blackboard in the background with a sketch of a neural network. In the foreground is a college student typing on computer, drawn in the style of fun 2D vector artwork.”] 
It’s unclear just how deeply AI will become part of our daily lives. But what is certain is that for us to have meaningful conversations about AI, we need a shared vocabulary and a solid foundation of core concepts to build upon. As it stands, if you ask 10 people to define artificial intelligence, you’re likely to get 10 different answers. In this badge we try to reach an agreed-upon definition by exploring AI’s current capabilities. We also investigate how computer scientists create the AI systems that perform such incredible feats. 
The Difficulty of Defining AI
The first step in defining AI is to recognize that our current notion of AI might be a little distorted. A steady diet of science fiction books and movies where AI is seen as a nefarious entity bent on conquering the world hasn’t helped. 
Science fiction isn’t the only thing that’s complicated our view of AI. Generally speaking, we humans tend to think quite highly of ourselves; the benchmark by which everything else is measured. So when we speak of artificial intelligence, we can’t help but to compare it to our own intelligence. The problem is that humans aren’t the only intelligent beings out there. Animals, from crows to octopuses, use tools and problem solving to perform complex tasks. Even slime molds can solve mazes if given enough time. 
And as we’ve begun to appreciate the huge spectrum of intelligence in the animal kingdom, we’ve also started to recognize the great diversity in our own human intelligence. Maybe you’ve met someone who’s fantastic at public speaking but can’t do math to save their life. Or someone who can always tell when you’re feeling a little anxious, but would trip over a soccer ball at the first opportunity. The point is that our intelligence is expressed in many, specialized forms. We need to think of artificial intelligence in the same way. There are specific kinds of AI that are good at specific kinds of tasks. So let’s bring some definition to what we mean by artificial intelligence by taking a close look at what AI can do today. 
Main Types of AI Capabilities
Right now there’s no singular AI that’s good at everything. That idea, known as general AI, is still far into the future. Instead, over the years we’ve developed several specialized AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks. The kinds of tasks they do generally fall into one of a few broader categories. 
Numeric Predictions
Have you looked at a weather forecast recently? Predicting rain or shine helps you decide if you should grab an umbrella. Although we’ve made weather predictions for thousands of years, AI can do it better than any previous method. 
A good prediction can help you answer all sorts of questions. Is this customer likely to renew their subscription? Are you at risk for a medical condition? Will there be high demand on the power grid this evening? 
Often AI predictions take the form of a value between 0 (not going to happen) to 1 (totally going to happen). Numeric predictions include more than just percent values, they can predict any numeric value, such as dollars. Maybe your business wants to predict next quarter’s sales, or figure out the optimal pricing for your latest service: Widget+. And as a consumer you’re probably already affected by these kinds of numeric predictions, even more than you realize. Just imagine a trip overseas: the airline tickets, hotel room, ridesharing, and travelers insurance are all likely to be priced by AI to perfectly balance supply and demand.

The Trick Behind the Magic
What AI can do may seem like magic. And like magic, it’s natural to want a peek behind the curtain to see how it’s all done. What you’ll find is that computer scientists and researchers are using lots of data, math, and processing power in place of mirrors and misdirection. Learning how AI actually works will help you use it to its fullest potential, while avoiding pitfalls due to its limitations. 
The Shift from Crafting to Training
For decades, programmers have written code that takes an input, processes it using a set of rules, and returns an output. For example, here’s how to find the average from a set of numbers. 
•	Input: 5, 8, 2, 9  
•	Process: Add the values [5 + 8 + 2 + 9] then divide by the number of inputs [4] 
•	Output: 6  
This simple set of rules for turning an input into an output is an example of an algorithm. Algorithms have been written to perform some pretty sophisticated tasks. But some tasks have so many rules (and exceptions) that it’s impossible to capture them all in a hand-crafted algorithm. Swimming is a good example of a task that is hard to encapsulate as a set of rules. You might get some advice before jumping in the pool, but you only really figure out what works once you’re trying to keep your head above water. Some things are learned best by experience. 
What if we could train a computer in the same way? Not by tossing it into a pool, but by letting it figure out what works to succeed at a task? But just like learning to swim is very different from learning to speak a foreign language, the kind of training depends on the task. Let’s check out a few of the ways AI is trained. 
Experience Required
Imagine that every time you went to the store to pick up milk, you tracked details of the trip in a spreadsheet. It’s a little weird, but go with it. You set up the following columns. 
•	Is it the weekend? 
•	Time of day 
•	Is it raining or not? 
•	Distance to store 
•	Total minutes of trip 
After several trips you start getting a feel for how conditions affect how long it’ll take. Like, rain makes the drive longer, but it also means fewer people are shopping. Your brain makes connections between the inputs (weekend [W], time [T], raining [R], distance [D]) and the output (minutes [M]). 
 
But how can we get a computer to notice trends in the data so it can estimate too? One way is the guess-and-check method. Here’s how you do it. 
Step 1: Assign all of your inputs a “weight.” This is a number that represents how strongly an input should affect the output. It’s OK to start with the same weight for everything. 
Step 2: Use the weights with your existing data (and some clever math we won’t get into here) to estimate the minutes for a milk run. We can compare the estimate to the historic data. It’ll be way off, but that’s OK. 
Step 3: Let the computer guess a new weight for each input, making some a little more important than others. For example, the time of day might be more important than whether or not it’s raining. 
Step 4: Rerun the calculations to check if the new weights result in a better estimate. If so, it means the weights are a better fit, and changing in the right direction. 
Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4, letting the computer tweak weights until its estimates aren’t getting any better. 
At this point the computer has settled on weights for each input. If you think of weight as how strongly an input is connected to the output, you can make a diagram that uses line-thickness to represent the weight of a connection. 
 
For this example it looks like the time of day has the strongest connection, but apparently rain doesn’t make much of a difference. 
This process of guess-and-check has created a model of our milk runs. And like a model boat, we can take it to the pool to see if it floats, so to speak. That means testing it in the real world. So for your next several milk runs, before you leave, have the model estimate how long it’ll take. If it’s right enough times in a row, you can confidently let it do the estimating for every future trip. 
 
[AI-generated image using DreamStudio at stability.ai with the prompt, “A robot is at a workbench putting together the pieces of a small model sailboat. The picture is drawn in 2D vector art style.”] 
Use the Right Data for the Right Job
This is a very simple example of using training to make an AI model, but it touches on some important ideas. First, it’s an example of machine learning (ML), which is the process of using large amounts of data to train a model to make predictions, instead of handcrafting an algorithm. 
Second, not all data is the same. In our milk run example, the spreadsheet is what we would call structured data. It is well organized, with labels on every column so you know the significance of every cell. In contrast, unstructured data would be something like a news article, or an unlabeled image file. The kind of data that you have available will affect what kind of training you can do. 
Third, the structured data from our spreadsheet lets computers do supervised learning. It’s considered supervised because we can make sure every piece of input data has a matching, expected output that we can verify. Conversely, unstructured data is used for unsupervised learning, which is when AI tries to find connections in the data without really knowing what it’s looking for. 
Letting the computer figure out a single weight for each input is just one kind of training regimen. But often interconnected systems are more complicated than what 1-to-1 weighting can represent. Thankfully, as you learn in the next unit, there are other ways to train!

•	Describe the role of neural networks in machine learning. 
•	Define the major components of neural networks.

Trailcast
If you'd like to listen to an audio recording of this module, please use the player below. When you’re finished listening to this recording, remember to come back to each unit, check out the resources, and complete the associated assessments. 
The Need for Neural Networks
No conversation about AI is complete without mentioning neural networks. Neural networks are important tools for training AI models, so it’s good to have some idea of what they are. But before we get into the details, let’s first discuss why we need neural networks in the first place. 
In the previous unit, you learned that we can train an AI model by letting it guess-and-check the importance-weight of each input. But the milk run example was actually overly simplified. Our model would give us pretty rough estimates. To understand why, let’s consider two scenarios. 
1.	It’s raining on a Tuesday evening. You’d rather not get wet, so you (and many others like you) decide shopping can wait until tomorrow. In this scenario, rain is a significant factor. 
2.	It’s raining on Saturday afternoon. For many people, this is the only time of week when they can go shopping. So the store will be busy, rain or shine. In this scenario, rain doesn’t make much difference. 
The problem is that our original model can only assign one weight to rain, but we know it’s more complicated than that. There is a solution, though, and it starts by representing the two scenarios in two separate graphs. Again, line thickness shows importance. In the first, “weekend” and “time” are weak, while “rain” is strong. For the second, “weekend” is strong, while “time” and “rain” is weak. 
 
We know these two scenarios are significant because we’re smart and have experience buying milk. But a computer just starting to learn about milk runs doesn’t know anything yet! It has to consider many scenarios: weekend-evening-rain, weekday-morning-shine, and so forth. Instead of two graphs, eight might better represent the kinds of scenarios you encounter. 
 
That’s a lot of very similar graphs. Since the three inputs always represent “weekend,” “time,” and “rain,” you can overlap them. If you move the outputs so they aren’t touching, you get a combined graph that looks like this. 
 
The importance of each scenario depends on the specific inputs. But knowing the importance is only half the battle. Each scenario needs to affect the final estimate in its own way. 
For example, the weekend-afternoon-shine milk run should take much longer. So let’s give it an adjustment of +5. When we do the math to calculate an estimate, it results in a larger number. While we’re at it, let’s give the weekday-morning-rain scenario an adjustment of -4 since we know milk runs are shortest at that time. 
Each scenario gets its own adjustment, which is what we call a bias. In this case, bias is a good thing because it helps us get a more accurate estimate. Let’s redraw our graph to include the bias of each scenario. 
 
So what do we do with these eight scenarios and their biases? Using some more clever math, we can combine them into a final estimate. Some scenarios should contribute more than others, so you guessed it, we need more weights! We can update our graph to show how the scenarios connect to the final estimate with different strengths. 
 
This is our new model. More connections will hopefully mean better estimates. This web of connections, guided by weights and biases, is an example of a neural network. We call it that because the connections, forged by experience (data), resemble how the neurons in a brain are connected. 
And while scenario is a good beginner word for describing a unique combination of factors, we should really use the word node for that concept. It’s what AI experts use, so moving forward we’ll use it too. 
Adding Complexity to Neural Networks
Our new milk run model is a pretty basic example of a neural network. In practice, they can get quite complex. Let’s explore some of the ways researchers set up neural networks to get better results for specific tasks. 
First, you might be wondering why we chose eight nodes to stand between our inputs and output. There’s actually some flexibility in that number. We know that having no nodes at all will give us rough estimates. In the same way, having too few might not capture all of the nuance of the system we’re trying to model. But having too many nodes is a problem, too. We don’t want to make the computer do more calculations than necessary. So there’s a sweet spot for the number of nodes where we get good results for the least effort. Choosing the right number is part of designing a good neural network. 
There’s something else we can do to make artificial neural networks more like our own, organic ones. It has to do with how our minds often leap from idea to idea to find connections between two things that are not obviously related. Some of the most brilliant insights are the result of several leaps. So, what if we could make a neural network that could make more leaps, too? We can! We do it by adding more nodes as layers, connecting each node to its neighbor. 
 
Training AI by adding extra layers to find hidden meaning in data is what’s called deep learning. Thanks to an abundance of computing power, many neural networks are designed to have multiple layers. Again, the best number of layers is a balance between the number of calculations required and the quality of results they produce. 
More Than Mental Math, It’s Neural Network Math
So, about those calculations. Up to this point we’ve glossed over the math part of training neural networks. That’s for a few reasons. First, the math can get really complicated, really fast. For example, here’s a snippet of a research paper about neural networks.
 
Yeah, it’s intense! 
Second, the exact math is going to depend on what kind of task you’re training the neural network to do. Third, each new research paper updates the math as we learn what works better at training different models. 
So, designing a neural network involves choosing the number of nodes, layers, and the appropriate math for the task it’s training for. With the model architecture ready, you have to let the computer use all that fancy math to do its guess-and-check routine. Eventually it’ll figure out the best weights and biases to give good estimates. 
And this brings us to something that’s a little unsettling about artificial neural networks. Imagine a skilled talent scout who’s looking for the next great baseball player. “I’ll know him when I see him,” they might say. They can’t explain how they’ll know, they just will. In the same way, our neural network can’t explain why certain factors are important. Sure, we can look at the values attached to each weight and bias, but the relevance of a number that’s the result of a connection of a connection of a connection will be lost to us. 
So just like how the mind of the talent scout is a black box, so is our neural network. Because we don’t observe the layers between the input and output, they’re referred to as hidden layers. 
Wrap Up
To summarize, neural networks are a mix of nodes, layers, weights, biases, and a bunch of math. Together they mimic our own organic neural networks. Each neural network is carefully tuned for a specific task. Maybe it’s great at predicting rain, maybe it categorizes plants, or maybe it keeps your car centered in the lane on the highway. Whatever the task, neural networks are a big part of what makes AI seem magical. And now you know a little bit about how the trick is done.

Classifications
Is a hot dog a sandwich? This question has led to countless hours of friendly philosophical debate about how we categorize things. But in the real world, the stakes can be much higher. Is this plant edible or poisonous? Is that email legitimate or a phishing attempt? Classification is often the first step in taking some kind of action, making it an incredibly valuable skill. 
So it isn’t surprising that computer scientists have worked hard to create AI that’s good at classifying data. Identifying plants and phishing emails is only the tip of the iceberg. Financial institutions need to flag fraudulent transactions. Medical professionals must diagnose illnesses. Social media platforms want to identify toxic comments. All of these are examples of classification problems. AI can effectively make the first pass at classifying, and then the professionals can take it from there. 
Often, AI classifiers can do the job just as well, or better, than humans. That said, each classifier is only good at one, narrow task. So the AI that’s great at detecting phishing emails would be lousy at identifying pictures of actual fish. 
Robotic Navigation
Some AIs excel at navigating a changing environment, and that might mean actual navigation in the case of autonomous (hands-free) driving. AI-powered cars are already quite capable of keeping centered in a lane and following at a safe distance on the highway. They adapt to curves in the road, gusts of wind from semi trucks, and sudden stops due to traffic. 
AI that can adapt to changing environmental conditions have all sorts of real-world applications. For example, businesses need to produce and deliver products to their customers every day. Lots of market conditions play a role in how quickly that gets done: materials availability, manufacturing capacity, existing inventory, transportation costs, even real-time traffic. AI can optimize the supply chain even while conditions are changing. 
And let’s not forget robots! Even the modest robot floor sweeper can avoid stairs and chairs. On a bigger scale, assembly lines are being fitted with robots that become faster and more efficient over time. Those same robots can adjust for changes to the production method without costly reprogramming. And researchers are creating rescue robots that can traverse disaster areas, such as a collapsed building. A robot-caterpillar that can squeeze through tiny cracks could deliver aid and hope to those trapped inside. 
Language Processing
On November 30, 2022, Merriam-Webster’s word of the day was quiddity. Those who learned that word got a little better at what might be the most important skill of all: communication. On that same day, the world was introduced to ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence that demonstrated its own communication skills. It could write long responses to questions about almost any topic. And the responses seemed like they were written by a human. ChatGPT is one of the most capable AIs built to interpret everyday language and act on it in some meaningful way. This is known in the industry as natural language processing, or just NLP. 
Natural language processing relies on an understanding of how words are used together, and that lets AI extract the intention behind the words. For example, you might want to translate a document from English to German. Or maybe you want a short summary of a long, scientific paper. AI can do that too. 
NLP is a huge part of generative AI, a subcategory of AI that takes words and turns them into unique images, sounds, and of course other words. Generative AI is such a disruptive technology that we’ve devoted a whole badge to Generative AI Basics. Check it out when you’re done here. 
In Summary
Artificial intelligence can be thought of as the ability for a computer to perform skills typically associated with human intuition, inference, and reasoning. At this time, AI skills are very specialized, and fall into some broad categories like numeric predictions and language processing. 
Now that you have a sense of what AI is (and isn’t), you’re ready to explore how computer scientists and researchers create AI.

Streamline Customer Service with Automation 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Explain how automation makes your entire service team more efficient and your customers happier. 
•	Describe how to map business problems to automation solutions. 
•	List Service Cloud features you can use to automate service tasks. 
What’s Automation for Service?
Customer service is about providing a smooth and simple journey that meets each customer’s needs. It often takes many steps, agents, and systems to complete that journey. Automation helps to streamline the process.  
For example, what if you could automate a repetitive task, like entering customer details only once and having them show up wherever they’re needed across the company? This process saves time for the customer and service team while ensuring accuracy. Likewise, automating complex processes across your entire business ensures that your team has the tools they need when customers are sent to the next stage in their journey. 
Here’s a quick video overview of the service experience. While you watch it, think about how this service journey is automated and ways you could adapt it to your business. 
Improve Customer Service with Automation
Let’s see how you can implement automation to solve common service scenarios. 
Business Challenge 	Solution 	Result 
Agents don’t have access to the data they need to help customers. 	Create a 360-degree view of the customer that’s shared across teams and integrated from any third-party system. 	Increased customer satisfaction and faster average handle time for calls. 
Complicated business processes are hard to coordinate across teams. 	Use workflows and real-time collaboration tools to connect teams so they can swarm more efficiently and resolve issues faster. 	Faster resolution of complicated cases. 
Agents struggle to manage a high volume of cases. 	Use AI to triage cases with machine learning, assist agents with actionable insights, and move the process forward with recommendations. 	Increase agent productivity and first-call resolution. 
Customers don't have convenient options to resolve issues on their own. 	Create a workflow once and embed it in self-service portals or surface it in chat and messaging channels via a chatbot so customers can self-serve. 	Scale your support by deflecting cases and lowering the cost to serve each customer. 
Your company has had a few big service disruptions and customers didn’t get the latest information and support they needed. 	Set up Incident Management to track disruptions and delegate tasks to the right experts in a crisis. 	Turn disruptions into a positive experience where customers feel supported and build loyalty.

Get to Know Natural Language Processing 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Describe natural language processing. 
•	Discuss everyday uses of natural language processing. 
•	Explain how it has evolved since the 1950s. 
•	Differentiate between natural language processing, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. 
Before You Start
This badge contains terms like neural networks and deep learning that are described in detail in the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals and Generative AI Basics badges. We recommend that you earn those badges first. 
What Is Natural Language Processing?
Natural language processing (NLP), is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that combines computer science and linguistics to give computers the ability to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that’s meaningful and useful to humans. 
NLP helps computers perform useful tasks like understanding the meaning of sentences, recognizing important details in text, translating languages, answering questions, summarizing text, and generating responses that resemble human responses. 
NLP is already so commonplace in our everyday lives that we usually don’t even think about it when we interact with it or when it does something for us. For example, maybe your email or document creation app automatically suggests a word or phrase you could use next. You may ask a virtual assistant, like Siri, to remind you to water your plants on Tuesdays. Or you might ask Alexa to tell you details about the last big earthquake in Chile for your daughter’s science project. 
The chatbots you engage with when you contact a company’s customer service use NLP, and so does the translation app you use to help you order a meal in a different country. Spam detection, your online news preferences, and so much more rely on NLP. 
A Very Brief History of NLP
It’s worth mentioning that NLP is not new. In fact, its roots wind back to the 1950s when researchers began using computers to understand and generate human language. One of the first notable contributions to NLP was the Turing Test. Developed by Alan Turing, this test measures a machine’s ability to answer any question in a way that’s indistinguishable from a human. Shortly after that, the first machine translation systems were developed. These were sentence- and phrase-based language translation experiments that didn’t progress very far because they relied on very specific patterns of language, like predefined phrases or sentences. 
 
By the 1960s, researchers were experimenting with rule-based systems that allowed users to ask the computer to complete tasks or have conversations. 
The 1970s and 80s saw more sophisticated knowledge-based approaches using linguistic rules, rule-based reasoning, and domain knowledge for tasks like executing commands and diagnosing medical conditions. 
Statistical approaches (i.e., learning from data) to NLP were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, leading to advances in speech recognition, machine translation, and machine algorithms. During this period, the introduction of the World Wide Web in 1993 made vast amounts of text-based data readily available for NLP research. 
 
Since about 2009, neural networks and deep learning have dominated NLP research and development. NLP areas of translation and natural language generation, including the recently introduced ChatGPT, have vastly improved and continue to evolve rapidly. 
 
Note:  
For more information about these and other important NLP advances, check out the Resources section. 
Human Language Is “Natural” Language
What is natural language anyway? Natural language refers to the way humans communicate with each other using words and sentences. It’s the language we use in conversations, when we read, write, or listen. Natural language is the way we convey information, express ideas, ask questions, tell stories, and engage with each other. While NLP models are being developed for many different human languages, this module focuses on NLP in the English language. 
If you completed the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals badge, you learned about unstructured data and structured data. These are important terms in NLP, too. Natural language–the way we actually speak–is unstructured data, meaning that while we humans can usually derive meaning from it, it doesn’t provide a computer with the right kind of detail to make sense of it. The following paragraph about an adoptable shelter dog is an example of unstructured data. 
Tala is a 5-year-old spayed, 65-pound female husky who loves to play in the park and take long hikes. She is very gentle with young children and is great with cats. This blue-eyed sweetheart has a long gray and white coat that will need regular brushing. You can schedule a time to meet Tala by calling the Troutdale shelter. 
For a computer to understand what we mean, this information needs to be well-defined and organized, similar to what you might find in a spreadsheet or a database. This is called structured data. The information included in structured data and how the data is formatted is ultimately determined by algorithms used by the desired end application. For example, data for a translation app is structured differently than data for a chatbot. Here’s how the data in the paragraph above might look as structured data for an app that can help match dogs with potential adopters. 
•	Name: Tala 
•	Age: 5 
•	Spayed or Neutered: Spayed 
•	Sex: Female 
•	Breed: Husky 
•	Weight: 65 lbs. 
•	Color: Gray and white 
•	Eye color: Blue 
•	Good with children: Yes 
•	Good with cats: Yes 
•	Favorite activities: Parks, hikes 
•	Location: Troutdale 
Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation
Today’s NLP matured with its two subfields, natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). Data processed from unstructured to structured is called natural language understanding (NLU). NLU uses many techniques to interpret written or spoken language to understand the meaning and context behind it. You learn about these techniques in the next unit. 
Data processed the reverse way–from structured to unstructured–is called natural language generation (NLG). NLG is what enables computers to generate human-like language. NLG involves the development of algorithms and models that convert structured data or information into meaningful, contextually appropriate, natural-like text or speech. It also includes the generation of code in a programming language, such as generating a Python function for sorting strings. 
In the past, NLU and NLG tasks made use of explicit linguistic structured representations like parse trees. While NLU and NLG are still critical to NLP today, most of the apps, tools, and virtual assistants we communicate with have evolved to use deep learning or neural networks to perform tasks from end-to-end. For instance, a neural machine translation system may translate a sentence from, say, Chinese, directly into English without explicitly creating any kind of intermediate structure. Neural networks recognize patterns, words, and phrases to make language processing exponentially faster and more contextually accurate. 
In the next unit, you learn more about our natural language methods and techniques that enable computers to make sense of what we say and respond accordingly.

Learn About Natural Language Parsing 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Discuss the basic elements of natural language. 
•	Describe several important techniques used when parsing natural language. 
•	Explain how sentiment, intent, and context analysis contribute to NLP. 
Basic Elements of Natural Language
Understanding and processing natural language is a fundamental challenge for computers. That's because it involves not only recognizing individual words, but also comprehending their relationships, their context, and their meaning. 
Our natural language, in text and speech, is characterized by endless complexity, nuances, ambiguity, and mistakes. In our everyday communication, we encounter words with several meanings; words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings; misplaced modifiers; misspellings; and mispronunciations. We also encounter people who speak fast, mumble, or who take forever to get to the point; and people who use speech patterns in accents or dialects that are different from ours. 
Take this sentence for example: 
“We saw six bison on vacation in Yellowstone National Park.” 
You might giggle a little as you imagine six bison in hats and sunglasses posing for selfies in front of Old Faithful. But, most likely, you understand what actually happened–that is, that someone who was on vacation in Yellowstone National Park saw six bison. 
Or this: 
“They swam out to the buoy.” 
If you heard someone speak this sentence without any context, you may think the people involved swam out to a male child, when in fact, they swam out to a marker in the water. The pronunciation of “boy” and “buoy” is slightly different, but the enunciation is not always made clear. 
While humans are able to flex and adapt to language fairly easily, training a computer to consider these kinds of nuances is quite difficult. 
Elements of natural language in English include: 
•	Vocabulary: The words we use 
•	Grammar: The rules governing sentence structure 
•	Syntax: How words are combined to form sentences according to grammar 
•	Semantics: The meaning of words, phrases, and sentences 
•	Pragmatics: The context and intent behind cultural or geographic language use 
•	Discourse and dialogue: Units larger than a single phrase or sentence, including documents and conversations 
•	Phonetics and phonology: The sounds we make when we communicate 
•	Morphology: How parts of words can be combined or uncombined to make new words 
Parsing Natural Language
Teaching a computer to read and derive meaning from words is a bit like teaching a child to read–they both learn to recognize words, their sounds, meaning, and pronunciation. But when a child learns to read, they usually have the advantage of context from a story; visual cues from illustrations; and relationships to things they already know, like trees or animals. They also often get assistance and encouragement from experienced readers, who help explain what they’re learning. These cues help new readers identify and attach meaning to words and phrases that they can generalize to other things they read in the future. 
 
We know that computers are a different kind of smart, so while a computer needs to understand the elements of natural language described above, the approach needs to be much more scientific. NLP uses algorithms and methods like large language models (LLMs), statistical models, machine learning, deep learning, and rule-based systems to process and analyze text. These techniques, called parsing, involve breaking down text or speech into smaller parts to classify them for NLP. Parsing includes syntactic parsing, where elements of natural language are analyzed to identify the underlying grammatical structure, and semantic parsing which derives meaning. 
As mentioned in the last unit, natural language is parsed in different ways to match intended outcomes. For example, natural language that’s parsed for a translation app uses different algorithms or models and is parsed differently than natural language intended for a virtual assistant like Alexa. 
Syntactic parsing may include: 
•	Segmentation: Larger texts are divided into smaller, meaningful chunks. Segmentation usually occurs at the end of sentences at punctuation marks to help organize text for further analysis. 
•	Tokenization: Sentences are split into individual words, called tokens. In the English language, tokenization is a fairly straightforward task because words are usually broken up by spaces. In languages like Thai or Chinese, tokenization is much more complicated and relies heavily on an understanding of vocabulary and morphology to accurately tokenize language. 
•	Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form, or stem. For example breaking, breaks, or unbreakable are all reduced to break. Stemming helps to reduce the variations of word forms, but, depending on context, it may not lead to the most accurate stem. Look at these two examples that use stemming: 
“I’m going outside to rake leaves.” 
Stem = leave  
“He always leaves the key in the lock.” 
Stem = leave  
•	Lemmatization: Similar to stemming, lemmatization reduces words to their root, but takes the part of speech into account to arrive at a much more valid root word, or lemma. Here are the same two examples using lemmatization: 
“I’m going outside to rake leaves.” 
Lemma = leaf  
“He always leaves the key in the lock.” 
Lemma = leave  
•	Part of speech tagging: Assigns grammatical labels or tags to each word based on its part of speech, such as a noun, adjective, verb, and so on. Part of speech tagging is an important function in NLP because it helps computers understand the syntax of a sentence. 
•	Named entity recognition (NER): Uses algorithms to identify and classify named entities–like people, dates, places, organizations, and so on–in text to help with tasks like answering questions and information extraction. 
Semantic Analysis
Parsing natural language using some or all of the steps we just described does a pretty good job of capturing the meaning of text or speech. But it lacks soft skill nuances that make human language, well, human. Semantic parsing involves analyzing the grammatical format of sentences and relationships between words and phrases to find the meaning representation. Extracting how people feel, why they are engaging, and details about circumstances surrounding an interaction all play a crucial role in accurately deciphering text or speech and forming an appropriate response. 
Here are several common analysis techniques that are used in NLP. Each of these techniques can be powered by a number of different algorithms to get the desired level of understanding depending on the specific task and the complexity of the analysis. 
Sentiment analysis: Involves determining whether a piece of text (such as a sentence, a social media post, a review, or a tweet) expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. A sentiment is a feeling or an attitude toward something. For example, sentiment analysis can determine if this customer review of a service is positive or negative: "I had to wait a very long time for my haircut.” Sentiment helps identify and classify emotions or opinions in text to help businesses understand how people feel about their products, services, or experiences. 
 
Intent analysis: Intent helps us understand what someone wants or means based on what they say or write. It’s like deciphering the purpose or intention behind their words. For example, if someone types, “I can’t log in to my account,” into a customer support chatbot, intent analysis would recognize that the person’s intent is to get help to access their account. The chatbot might reply with details about resetting a password or other means the user can try to access their account. Virtual assistants, customer support systems, or chatbots often use intent analysis to understand user requests and provide appropriate responses or actions. 
Context (discourse) analysis: Natural language relies heavily on context. The interpretation of a statement might change based on the situation, the details provided, and any shared understanding that exists between the people communicating. Context analysis involves understanding this surrounding information to make sense of a piece of text. For example, if someone says, “They had a ball,” context analysis can determine if they are talking about a fancy dance party, a piece of sports equipment, or a whole lot of fun. It does this by considering the previous conversation or the topic being discussed. Context analysis helps NLP systems interpret words more accurately by taking into account the broader context, the relationships between words, and other relevant information. 
These three analysis techniques–sentiment analysis, intent analysis, and context analysis–play important roles in extracting valuable insights from text and speech data. They create a more sophisticated and accurate understanding and engagement with textual content in various applications of NLP. 
Summary
In this module, you’ve learned about NLP at a very high level, and as it relates to the English language. To-date, the majority of NLP study is conducted using English, but you can also find a great deal of research done in Spanish, French, Farsi, Urdu, Chinese, and Arabic. NLP is a very rapidly evolving field of AI. And advancements in NLP are quickly leading to more sophisticated language understanding, cross-language capabilities, and integration with other AI fields.

Explore Machine Learning Predictions 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Understand what machine learning can do for your CRM data.
•	Identify ways to use machine learning predictions.
Unlock the Power of Your Data  
Today, trillions of gigabytes of data exist. And as a company in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), the data you possess can predict future outcomes and drive decision-making. But according to the Salesforce Untapped Data Research, most companies aren’t harnessing the power of their data’s potential even though four out of five (80%) business leaders say data is critical to decision-making. 
Using a type of AI called machine learning (ML), you can transform historical data into predictive insights. This is known as predictive AI, which is different from generative AI. 
•	Predictive AI informs, using existing data to discover something new about the data. For example, predictive AI estimates the likelihood of attrition or fraud.
•	Generative AI assists, using existing data to create new data similar to what already exists. For example, generative AI creates new text and images.
To learn more about predictive vs generative AI, check out the Discover AI Techniques and Applications unit in Data Fundamentals for AI. 
Inject Machine Learning into Your Business 
Predictive insights from machine learning enable business users to make better decisions, faster. Use predictive AI from machine learning to drive innovation, efficiency, and strategic decision-making across your organization. Here are some of the top use cases for predictive insights (but there are plenty more).

Benefit from Machine Learning, No Data Science Experience Required 
You don’t need to be a data scientist to leverage machine learning. While data scientists are often involved in training and refining ML models, the insights from the model are meant for the business users. According to the Harvard Business Review, data scientists struggle to communicate the value of ML insights and cite “results not used by decision makers” as one of the top challenges. 
Adding ML to Salesforce bridges the gap between data scientists and the business. In Salesforce, users can make decisions and take actions on the ML insights, without having to read a data science report.
You can transform historical data into meaningful insights for your organization using Einstein.
1.	Einstein Studio: Use the ML-powered insights in Data Cloud with Connected Models data science teams already built by connecting to it and bringing the model’s insights into Salesforce. You can leave the model where it is (like AWS SageMaker), and leverage its ML-powered insights within Salesforce.
2.	Einstein Discovery: Build your own ML model from the ground up in CRM Analytics, with Einstein’s guidance. Rely on Einstein to walk you through building, training, evaluating, and activating an ML model in Data Cloud.
Now you understand what machine learning can do for your data, and can identify ways your organization can benefit from ML-powered predictions.

Get Started with the Analytics 360 Integration for Sales Cloud 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Explain what Google Analytics 360 is.
•	Outline the values of the integration with Salesforce Sales Cloud.
•	List the integration requirements to get started.
 
This module was produced in collaboration with Google, which owns, supports, and maintains the Google products, services, and features described here. Use of Google products, services, and features is governed by privacy policies and service agreements maintained by Google.
 
Universal Analytics 360 and the data sources it uses, universal properties (UA), are being sunset. Trailhead shall maintain these modules to support Trailblazers who continue to use these services until such time. We are hard at work developing content that supports the new Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration.
Online and Offline, Sales and Marketing, Connecting the Dots 
With customer touch points occurring across so many sources, it can be hard for marketing and sales teams to create a complete, accurate view of the customer story. It’s even harder when a large portion of the sales process occurs offline. Like chapters in a book, you need to have them all together for everything to make sense. 
When you have a complete view of the customer, you can understand how effective your marketing has been in delivering sales. You can improve the performance of your digital marketing by optimizing your bids or by focusing on the most valuable audiences. Sales teams can get even more targeted and relevant support to help them progress and close deals.
 
What is Google Marketing Platform and what is Analytics 360? 
Google Marketing Platform is a unified advertising and analytics platform that helps enterprise marketers make better decisions faster. With Google Marketing Platform, you’re in control of your marketing, so you have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of your business and your customers. 
Google Analytics 360*, part of Google Marketing Platform, gives you the tools you need to better understand your customers. Use the insights you learn to take action, such as improving your website, creating tailored audience lists, and more. In addition to the features available in Google Analytics, Analytics 360 provides additional capabilities:
•	Advanced Analysis
•	Unsampled reports
•	Google BigQuery export
•	Data-driven attribution
•	Native integrations with Google Marketing Platform
•	Integrations with Salesforce
*There is an annual license fee for Analytics 360 and Salesforce is an authorized reseller.
How Salesforce and Google Put It All Together 
With the Sales Cloud and Google Analytics 360 integration, you can link your accounts and import your Sales Cloud data directly into Analytics 360 and get a more complete view of the entire customer story, whether it happens online, offline, or both. This will help you better optimize your digital marketing and bring more customers to your sales teams.
This integration is designed to save time, get more valuable insights, help you optimize your media, and customize your marketing experiences for specific audiences. 
Save Time. Combining all of these offline and online insights used to be a time-consuming process involving multiple spreadsheets and disparate data. This integration helps you cut down on the wait time from importing offline conversion data and helps you stitch together these insights automatically, updating as often as hourly.
Get More Insights. With Sales Cloud data in Analytics 360, you can see offline sales data alongside your site analytics and media data. For example, is organic search driving more phone sales compared to paid search? With your offline sales data from Salesforce Sales Cloud in Analytics 360, you now have the insights to help you answer this question, and many more.
Optimized Media for Better ROI. Optimize paid media based on offline sales activity. For example, once you’ve created Goals in Analytics 360 based on your Sales Cloud events, you can automatically optimize your search or display campaigns for actual sales that occur offline, instead of optimizing for form submissions on your site. This will likely lead to improved ROI as you spend your digital media budgets on more valuable outcomes.
Intelligently Build Audiences. With Sales Cloud data in Analytics 360, you will be able to more intelligently build audiences based on the intersection of online and offline data. For instance, you can create audiences in Analytics 360 made up of qualified leads from Sales Cloud. You can then reach those customers with more relevant ads, including search ads, display ads, and video ads.
Two Things You Need to Know 
There are two key requirements you should keep in mind if you are interested in using this integration.
1.	You must be a licensee of both Salesforce Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 in order to use this integration. This integration is only available to customers who have purchased Analytics 360.
2.	The integration supports sharing data from Sales Cloud Objects Leads and Opportunities. The Leads and Opportunities shared with Analytics 360 must have originated from an Analytics 360-tagged site for the integration to work, and the lead can be created either via an online lead form (native integration) or via a phone call (custom solution adding a call tracking solution).
 
If your organization uses Custom Objects, you may have to use an alternative setup depending on how those Custom Objects are deployed. Please refer to Unit 3: Dive Into Some Use Cases and Examples and corresponding resources, or consult with your service provider for more details.

Learn Setup and Administration 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Identify the key roles involved in integrating Sales Cloud and Analytics 360.
•	List the technical and administrative steps needed to complete the integration.
In this unit, we review the technical steps required to integrate Sales Cloud and Analytics 360. The good news is that linking your Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 accounts is easy!
What’s Required? 
You will need login and administrative access to both Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud, as you’ll need to both configure Sales Cloud to collect certain data and then Analytics 360 to map to and receive that data.
 
Key Roles 
While stakeholders may vary depending on company size and organization, there are typically 3 key roles needed to ensure a successful integration of Sales Cloud and Analytics 360:
1.	Analytics Lead and/or Admin. An Analytics 360 Administrator is necessary to create a new data import from Sales Cloud and set up the new events within Analytics 360. This requires proper credentials within Analytics 360.
2.	CRM Lead and/or Admin. A Salesforce Administrator will need to set up the link with Analytics 360 and create the fields in Sales Cloud to store key data—Analytics Client ID (GACLID) and Google Analytics Tracking ID—in the Lead and Opportunity objects.
3.	Web Development Lead. A web developer is necessary to modify the lead collection form on your website and add the GACLID to the parameters passed to Sales Cloud upon lead submission.
The size and complexity of your implementation will influence who is on the integration team. How your company is organized will also influence who is on the integration team. When you are organizing your team and considering who your stakeholders are, keep in mind, one of the main goals is to allow the marketing team and the sales team to work better together.
Permissions 
The user performing the linking must be an Admin (have Edit permissions) for the Analytics 360 implementation. The Analytics 360 Sales Cloud Data Import requires access to several Salesforce fields, organized by object. A Sales Cloud user with System Administrator access likely has access to all necessary fields.
Create Custom Fields in Sales Cloud 
Create three new custom fields where you will store the Google Analytics IDs in Sales Cloud. You can name these fields however you’d like. The names below provide examples. Once created, you select and map these fields at the Data Import configuration setup stage.
•	Client ID: one with the Field Name, e.g., GACLIENTID 
•	User ID: (optional) another with the Field Name, e.g., GAUSERID 
•	Tracking ID: another one with the Field Name, e.g., GATRACKID 
These custom fields need to be created on both Lead and Opportunity objects and mapped between the 2 objects so that once a lead is converted into an opportunity, these fields are copied over. Also, you should ensure that status and stages have history tracking on.
Adjust Your Lead Form 
Adjust your lead form to pass the required information into Sales Cloud. 
1.	Add ClientID as well as User ID (optional) into your lead form as new hidden input field(s).
2.	Add Tracking ID in your lead form as a new hidden input field with the value matching the Tracking ID for your site.
Link Analytics 360 to Your Sales Cloud Account 
In this step, you'll link Analytics to your Salesforce Sales Cloud account by creating a new Data Import data set, and then by authorizing access to your Sales Cloud account.
1.	First, log in to your Google Analytics 360 account and navigate to Admin > Property, then click Data Import to Create a new Data Import Schema.
2.	Select the Salesforce type under CRM Data to import data about offline conversions from Sales Cloud.
3.	Name and save your Data Set. For example, Salesforce Offline Conversions.
4.	Create a new Sales Cloud authorization by naming the Credentials set to reuse later (for example, GA-SC) and click Access Salesforce.com to log in to your Sales Cloud account in the pop-up and complete the linking. The pop-up will automatically close upon successful login authentication and the linking will be completed.
 
Select the Milestones to Import 
In this step, you'll select the Salesforce lead and opportunity milestones to import. You'll also choose how often to import them.
1.	Select the Lead and/or Opportunity milestone(s) that you want to import as Events from your Sales Cloud account to Analytics 360. For example: 
o	Lead: Contacted
o	Lead: Qualified
o	Opportunity: Open / Proposal
o	Opportunity: Closed / Won
o	Opportunity: Closed / Lost
2.	You also have the option to import attribute and product data. Attribute data import allows you to import user attributes from custom fields and selected standard fields from your Salesforce Lead and Opportunity objects. This includes: 
o	Industry
o	NumberOfEmployees
o	Rating
o	ScoreIntelligenceId
This step is highly recommended, as these attributes enable a wide variety of new audience targeting and analysis use cases.
Set Import Frequency and Verify Setup 
You’re almost there! In this final step, you’ll first have the opportunity to define the frequency of data import—hourly is recommended. 
1.	In the Analytics 360 UI, navigate to Admin > Property > Data Import and click Manage Uploads. 
2.	In the Uploads for Salesforce Offline Conversions page, click More, then Fetch Now. This will attempt to upload your Sales Cloud data to Analytics. If the upload is successful, the Status column will show Completed. If an error occurs, the Status column shows Failed with a link to display more details.

Dive Into Some Use Cases and Examples 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe several use cases for the Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 integration.
•	Understand how data from Sales Cloud and Google Marketing Platform in Google Cloud can be used for advanced marketers.
Now that you’ve learned the basics about the Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 integration, let’s dive deeper into use cases and examples of how our platforms can work together to empower your sales and marketing teams to work better together.
Visualize the Full Sales Funnel from Online to Offline 
Use Online Events from Analytics 360 and Offline Events Imported from Sales Cloud 
One of the simplest but most effective ways to get value from this integration is to explore your offline Sales Cloud data directly in Analytics 360.
1.	First, ensure that you are tracking the relevant steps of the online funnel with events. For example, if you want to look at the funnel of users who visited your product page then submitted a lead and finally converted, you should set up an event in Analytics 360 for when a user visits your product page.
2.	From there, create a custom report that looks at each of those events, the online events measured by Analytics 360 (e.g., the product page visit and the lead form submission) and the offline events imported from Sales Cloud (e.g., lead and opportunity milestones). Then analyze your full online to offline funnel to understand the performance of your different marketing channels.
Use Custom Funnels and Build Targeted Audiences
Using the Custom Funnels feature in Analytics 360, you can visualize the steps your users are taking to complete a purchase on your website and take action where there is drop off. Now with your Sales Cloud data integrated into Analytics 360, you can use Custom Funnels to see how successful your business is at turning online leads measured in Analytics 360 into offline sales measured in Sales Cloud.
Imagine you are a solar panel company, and your website has a lead form potential customers can use to get in touch with a member of your sales team. Now, you can use Custom Funnels to visualize what percentage of leads submitted online were converted to in-person consult, and then which of those went on to purchase the solar panels. These visual reports help you identify drop-off points so that you can fine-tune the customer experience and improve marketing performance.
 
1.	To take immediate action from Custom Funnels, you can simply click Create new segment to build an audience of people who have dropped off from a particular stage. Once you have that audience segment built, you can use it for media targeting, site personalization, or qualitative research. For example, you could build a segment of customers who have filled out the online lead form but have not scheduled a call with a sales agent. You could use digital ads or custom site messaging to encourage this group to follow up. You learn more about this in the sections below. 
2.	Then, with advanced attribution tools in Analytics 360, such as Data-driven Attribution, you can create more accurate cross-channel attribution models so you can better understand what channels drive offline sales. For example, after you apply a data-driven statistical model, you may uncover that paid search and email drives more offline solar panel installations than social. You can use this information to adjust your investment for paid search and email—improving your return on ad spend (ROAS) in the process.
Optimize Your Marketing Investment to Offline Goals 
Going one step further, you can also create Goals in Analytics 360 based on your Sales Cloud events and optimize your digital marketing campaigns for sales that occur offline, instead of just optimizing for form submissions on your site. 
How? Simply share these goals (triggered by offline events imported from Sales Cloud) to Google Ads and Search Ads 360, then adapt your search bidding strategy to account for these goals.
 
For the solar company optimizing media for installations scheduled over the phone, this could mean paying more for keywords that drive those successful phone calls, and paying less for keywords which drive unqualified leads that do not convert to consultations or to eventual sales.
Intelligently Build Audiences with Sales Cloud Data 
In addition to more insightful reporting and smarter media optimization from offline data, the connection between Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud gives you even more audience attributes to work with, helping you improve the specificity of your audiences.
For example, if you’re an insurance company that generates leads online but sells policies in person via an agent, you could build an audience in Analytics 360 of all customers who have purchased an auto insurance policy offline. You could use that audience to either deliver relevant display ads (like new insurance products shown to those who browsed that page online) using Display & Video 360, or customize your website (like a customer service showcase) using Optimize 360.
 
Optimize 360, part of Google Marketing Platform, allows you to create different variations of your website and deliver a personalized experience that works for each customer. Powered by the native integration with Analytics 360, you can use Optimize 360 to conduct site testing and personalization on the insights you’ve gained from the Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud integration. 
 
You can even use Einstein Lead Scoring to build these audiences in the above use cases. For example, the solar company could build an Analytics 360 audience of users who filled out a lead form online and then were assigned an Einstein Lead Score of 80 or higher. Then, they can share that audience with Optimize 360 to ensure those qualified users have a unique site experience or to Display & Video 360 to deliver more relevant ads to keep them engaged.
Learn How You Can Delight Your Customers Even More 
Once you have built valuable audiences using Sales Cloud and Analytics 360, there are even more opportunities to learn about them and help you discover new, similar customers.
•	Similar Audiences. Similar Audiences is a powerful—but simple—way to reach a much larger audience and drive sales by algorithmically expanding the reach of your existing audiences. For example, you can import into Analytics 360 an audience of highly qualified leads from Sales Cloud, then send that list to Display & Video 360 to build a similar audience that looks like your prospects. You can show tailored ads to this list to try to grow new business.
•	Surveys. Google Surveys 360 gives you the ability to ask questions directly to your audiences, allowing you to learn more qualitative information from your users after you’ve engaged with them. For instance, you could ask your customers how they feel about your brand or your category, helping you to learn valuable and first-hand insights.
•	Google Cloud for deeper analysis. The integration between Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 also allows users to take advantage of Google Cloud. All your Analytics 360 data, including your imported Sales Cloud data, can be sent directly to Google Cloud’s BigQuery—a fast, highly scalable, cost-effective, and fully managed cloud data warehouse for analytics, with built-in machine learning. Learn more.
As you can see, by using the full capabilities of Salesforce Sales Cloud, Analytics 360 and Google Marketing Platform, you can deliver exceptional experiences for your customers and grow your business.

Assess Yourself 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	List the steps for creating a career plan. 
•	Identify your unique strengths, skills, and talents and what’s important to you. 
•	Describe the different elements of self-assessment. 
A Quick Introduction to Career Development
Whether you’re just starting out in your career or already have a few years of experience under your belt, it can be helpful to step back and think about your career plan. Career planning is not a one-time event; it’s an ongoing process to revisit throughout your career as your priorities and interests shift and change. 
 
Picture career development as a jungle gym to explore, not a ladder to climb. There are various directions you can explore: up, down, and sideways. When you’re clear about your career goals, you can choose the options that are the best fit. Then it’s time to get ready for new experiences or new roles. 
The career development process can be helpful to revisit when you’re thinking about switching careers or applying your existing experience to work in a new field. Or maybe you’re returning to work after a period out of the workforce. 
Developing a career plan involves three main steps or phases.
 
You can use these three simple steps to plan your career. 
•	Discover. Get to know yourself, including your motivations, experiences you want, skills to build, and career goals to achieve. Research and explore opportunities and career paths that interest you and that may not have considered before. 
•	Plan. Identify a goal and any skills you need to build or to reach that goal. Lay out a plan of how you will achieve that goal. 
•	Act.Take action on your plan. Identify how to get connected to employers and mentors that can help you. Prepare your resume and social media presence to land that dream job. 
Get to Know Yourself
The first step in managing your career is to get a clear picture of who you are and what you want. 
This includes: 
•	Knowing what motivates you and what matters in your life 
•	Identifying your strengths and opportunities to improve 
•	Finding out what you’re most interested in 
What we want can change over time—our priorities change, we can discover new interests or skills that we want to develop and learn. This is an opportunity to check in and see where you are today. 
 
There are many free self-assessment tools out there to help you identify your own values, skills, and interests. We’ve provided links to a few of them in the resources section. You may want to start by exploring some of these tools. 
We’ve also provided a Career Exploration Resources pack with worksheets to guide you through each step of the career development process. We recommend downloading it and finding a quiet place where you can work through it. 
What Motivates You
Think about that day you left work or school thinking “Wow, that was a great day!” 
Do you remember what was happening? Whatever it was, you were probably doing something that you found motivating and energizing. 
 
What you find motivating is unique to you and it’s the starting point in getting to know yourself. 
Examples of motivators include: 
•	Creativity and innovation 
•	Problem-solving 
•	Being an expert 
Curious about what motivates you? Complete the Values and Skills Assessment worksheet in the Career Exploration Resources pack you downloaded to identify your top 5. 
Next Steps
Once you’ve completed your self-assessment, review your results and identify any themes that emerge. It can be helpful to talk over your results with a friend or family member. 
Next we explore career options and see how they align with the themes you’ve identified.

Explore Career Options 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Describe the different job roles within the Salesforce ecosystem. 
•	Research potential career options that align to your interests. 
•	Identify skills and requirements for your target career goal. 
Researching Career Pathways
Now that you’ve looked inward to assess your current skills, interests, and values, it’s time to expand your view outward and explore different pathways that interest you. 
Perhaps you already have some ideas about roles that interest you. Perhaps you’ve thought about consulting, but aren’t sure what a day in the life is like for that role. Or perhaps there’s a specific industry that interests you, like healthcare or finance, but you’re not sure what the different roles are within that industry. Whatever your starting point, this is an opportunity to cast a wide net to see what options interest you. 
Here are a few ways to research different career pathways. 
•	Search job descriptions with keywords related to your interest. 
•	Talk to others who are already in roles you’re interested in. 
•	Attend industry events and meetups. 
•	Take people in your network out for coffee or lunch to learn more about other functions, teams, and roles. 
•	Shadow someone doing what you’d like to do in the future. 
•	Look for opportunities to be part of a special project to learn new skills. 
Labor Market Trends
One thing to consider as you research career options is the labor market demand for specific skills and roles. What are the jobs and industries experiencing the highest growth, and where are there more opportunities? 
Salesforce roles span multiple functional areas, including sales, IT, marketing, business management, and operations. As businesses embrace the future of mobile, big data, IoT, and AI, Salesforce skills are becoming some of the hottest skills to have on your resume, and that demand is growing. 
Knowing where the demand for a specific skill set, such as Salesforce skills, is strong can give you a starting point for researching different career options that draw upon those skills. 
Here are some places to look for labor market information. 
•	Occupational Outlook Handbook 
•	Glassdoor’s 50 Best Jobs List 
A Day in the Life
Another factor to consider during your research is the day-to-day activities of different roles. Does the role require more time working with others or working alone? Is the workday structured with lots of meetings or more self-directed? What types of problems does the role solve? 
Once you’ve identified specific roles that interest you, search online to find more information about a typical day for that role. Use LinkedIn or X to find people in your network with that role and ask to interview them. 
For Salesforce career pathways, you can read stories from Trailblazers who have built their careers on Salesforce. Or explore a typical day in the life of different career paths on the Salesforce Career Paths site. 
Conducting Your Research
We’ve provided some information on different career pathways within the Salesforce ecosystem as a starting point for researching career options that interest you. Read through the career profiles, the skills required, what a day in the life of each of these jobs is like, and some of the additional resources provided. You can also expand your exploration outside this list and do your own research on job roles that interest you. 
Once you’ve identified one or two roles that look interesting, complete the career exploration worksheet in the Career Exploration Resources packet you downloaded to do a deeper dive on those career options.

Land Your Next Opportunity 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Prepare for interviewing by creating your elevator pitch. 
•	Create your Salesforce resume and profile. 
•	Connect with employers. 
Now You're Ready!
Now that you know where you’re headed and you’ve created your plan to get there, it’s time to go out and land that next role. We’ve created a job seeker checklist, included in the Resources pack you downloaded, to help you make sure your personal presence is amazing both in person and online. 
 
Update Your Resume
If you haven’t updated your resume in a while, it’s time to dust it off and add in your most recent work experience, and any new skills and certifications you’ve earned. 
If you’re making a major career change or changing industries, consider hiring a professional to help you position your previous experience that is relevant for the new role. 
Make sure you proofread your resume carefully. Have a friend or family member read it over if you can. You don’t want to miss out on an opportunity because you missed a typo. 
Here are a few additional tips for creating a rock star resume. 
	DO THIS 	NOT THIS 
Use action verbs 	Trained 500 users on new sales processes. 	Responsible for end-user training. 
Highlight accomplishments 	Designed an automated lead qualification process using Salesforce that resulted in XYZ. 	Automated processes using Salesforce. 
Be accurate 	Include dates for each position you’ve held. 	Don’t leave off information. 
Don’t lie or provide incorrect information. 
Create Your Elevator Pitch
An elevator pitch is the 30-second story of who you are and where you want to go, and it usually ends with a specific ask or request. It’s your personal “commercial.” Hone and practice it until you can deliver it smoothly. 
Your elevator pitch is the perfect response to questions like, “Tell me about yourself” or “What do you do?” It can prepare you for that chance encounter with the company CEO in the elevator (or in the line at the coffee shop, or anywhere!). 
You can have slightly different versions of your pitch, depending on who you’re talking to, but the basic structure is the same. 
Elements to include 	Examples 
Who are you? What is your goal? 	•	I’m an experienced Salesforce administrator looking to move into a consulting role... 
•	I’m a recent MBA graduate looking for a role at a nonprofit... 
Why are you pursuing this goal? What is your motivation? 	•	I love helping teams optimize their use of Salesforce and tackling new challenges. 
•	I’ve been an avid hiker and camper since I was a kid, and I want to work for an organization that’s environmentally focused. 
What are the skills and strengths you bring? What is your key differentiator? 	•	I have 5 years’ experience as a Salesforce administrator, and I am a self-taught developer. I’ve earned 85 Trailhead badges and multiple certifications. 
•	I’ve successfully implemented Salesforce for a nonprofit, and I’m an expert with the Nonprofit Success Pack. 
What is your ask? What are the next steps? 	•	Can I get your business card to follow up and ask you a few questions? 
•	Do you have any recommendations of people I can speak with? 
•	Are you available to grab coffee in the next couple weeks? 
Polish Your Personal Brand
Your social media presence is the new resume. Employers and recruiters look to social media to learn more about candidates, so it’s important to make sure your profiles are top notch and that your personal brand is epic, amazing, and every bit as professionally compelling as you are in real life. 
Consider getting a professional headshot taken to use for all your social media profiles. Or use the best recent photo you have. 
DO THIS... 	NOT THAT... 
Your profile picture: 
•	Looks like you 
•	Is clear and in focus 
•	Is high-resolution (1400 x 425 pixels) 	Your profile picture does not: 
•	Include other people 
•	Look like you from 10 years ago 
•	Look out of focus or blurry 
Salesforce Profiles 
Complete your profile on Trailhead. Make sure you have a professional photo and use your newly perfected elevator pitch for your bio. 
X 
The Salesforce community is on X, so that’s a great place to look for news and information as well as establish yourself as a thought leader. 
	DO THIS 	NOT THAT 
X handle 	Choose an X handle that represents you professionally. 
•	One option is to use some version of your name, like @SusanSmith. 
•	Or use a handle that identifies your area of expertise, like @SusanCRMpro. 	Don’t use a handle that can be considered offensive. 
Profile 	Use a professional photo. 
Use your 160-character bio to describe to employers your key skills and accomplishments. 
Include a link to your LinkedIn profile or other site where employers can get more information. 	Don’t write your personal memoir. 
Don’t leave it blank or empty, and don’t sell yourself short. 
Content 	Tweet primarily about things that relate to your role or industry (consider setting up two accounts if you do a lot of personal tweeting). 
Follow people and companies that you’re interested in. 	
LinkedIn 
Show off the skills you’ve acquired on Trailhead by listing your badges and superbadges as well as any certifications. 
	DO THIS 	NOT THAT 
Job title and headline 	Use your current actual job title. 
If you are looking for work use a job title that conveys the type of role that you want to land.. 	Your job title shouldn’t lie. Tell it like it is. It’s a small world out there—it’s surprising how many connections you share with others. So keep it honest. 
Summary section 	Include a short description of yourself and what you do currently. 
Make sure your contact information is up to date. 
Market yourself as a leader—if you speak at events or have been recognized in your industry, make sure it’s on your profile. 	Don’t write your personal memoir. 
Don’t leave it blank or empty, and don’t sell yourself short. 
Don’t include anything that seems outlandish or too personal. 
Rich media 	Share content 2 to 3 times a week to keep your name fresh and to establish your professional brand. 
Add key work examples to your profile where appropriate. 	Don’t add things that aren’t relevant to your career and might confuse the viewer. 
Don’t overwhelm people by sharing content multiple times per day. 
Research Prospective Companies
Another important step in creating your career plan is identifying what type of company you want to work for so you can narrow your search. There are many types of companies within the Salesforce ecosystem where Salesforce skills are in demand. Here are a few examples. 
•	Salesforce customers: Salesforce customers span industries and include both large enterprise companies and small and medium-sized businesses. Check out our customer success stories for examples. 
•	Implementation partners: Our partners, also called system integrators, have deep technology and industry expertise and help get Salesforce up and running. They include international firms, and local and industry-specific partners who can give you a tailor-made implementation. 
•	AppExchange partners: These are companies that have built applications on the Force.com platform and sell them on AppExchange. 
•	Nonprofits: There are over 20,000 Salesforce nonprofit customers. See Salesforce.org success stories for examples. 
Here are some questions to ask yourself in narrowing your search. 
•	Do you prefer working for a small company or a large enterprise? 
•	Do you prefer a startup or a more established organization? 
•	What type of company culture do you prefer? 
•	Do you want to work for a nonprofit or mission-driven organization or a commercial enterprise? 
•	What industry are you most interested in? 
Search for Salesforce Opportunities
Ready to start your search? In addition to the general job sites such as dice.com, monster.com, and others, there are many specific job boards for Salesforce roles. Here are a few of the job boards. 
•	AppExchange Jobs Marketplace: Search for jobs by location or title, or post your profile for employers to find. 
•	Jobs at Salesforce: Work at the company voted “most innovative company in the world” for the past 5 years by Forbes magazine. 
•	Trailblazer Community: There are various groups dedicated to job search and job postings such as the Jobs Postings group. 
Connect with a Recruiter
Connect with recruiters that specialize in finding candidates for Salesforce roles. Here are just a few of the recruiters that specialize in recruiting talent with Salesforce skills. 
•	Mason Frank International 
•	Hire On-Demand 
•	Tech2 Resources 
Apply for a Job
Once you’ve identified an opportunity that you want to apply for, search on LinkedIn. See if there’s anyone in your network who works at that company and can provide more information or a recommendation or introduction. 
Review the company’s website and social media to learn more about the company’s business, culture, and products or services. 
Create a cover letter tailored to that job posting. Make sure you address how you fulfill the specific skills and competencies the employer is looking for, using the language they’ve used. Update your resume as needed to better target your experience to the posting. 
Feel free to use the job seeker checklist included in the Career Exploration Resource pack you downloaded.

Get to Know Workforce Navigators 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Explain the purpose of a workforce development program.
•	Describe the Workforce Navigators program.
•	Identify the benefits of the Workforce Navigators program.
What Are Workforce Development Programs? 
In simple terms, workforce development programs are a set of solutions that support job seekers in advancing their skill sets to meet current and future employment needs.
Recent Mckinsey studies indicate that taking a skills-based approach to building the future workforce is key. Employers and employees alike benefit from programs where job seekers gain new skills for better opportunities and increase the talent pipeline to meet future demands. 
Programs vary. They can include anything from specialized training to address a specific need for a company, to content with basic interview tips to help individuals succeed with their job search. Today, organizations across private industries, non-government, local agencies, and more offer workforce development programs. 
At Salesforce, we provide workforce development through a set of diverse programs dedicated to training and hiring for the jobs of tomorrow. These efforts stress equality for all. Our Workforce Navigators program aims to ensure that professionals with disabilities have the same opportunities as their peers to advance their career through training, mentorship, and certification opportunities within the Salesforce ecosystem.
Salesforce is in a unique position. We can foster our program of inclusion across partner organizations and customers and expand the reach and networks for job seekers with disabilities.

Committed to Equality and Inclusion 
At Salesforce, equality is one of our core company values. And we believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity to learn and grow. 
Everyone has a different path to career success, and we’re committed to empowering people with disabilities to find their success in the Salesforce ecosystem and to providing support on their journey. The Workforce Navigators program is an external-facing workforce development program within the Office of Accessibility at Salesforce.  
Established in 2020 and designed for job seekers with disabilities, Workforce Navigators supports individuals who want to learn more about Salesforce through learning opportunities, mentorship, and certification access. 
Since its inception, Workforce Navigators has helped many job seekers with disabilities along their journey. Through the program, we’ve partnered with multiple companies to help them develop a more inclusive and accessible career path for candidates with disabilities seeking employment.
Whether you’re a job candidate with a disability or an HR practitioner working in the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) space, inside or outside the Salesforce ecosystem, we want to help. We partner with companies to help them upskill their employees and offer the public free digital training, publishing resources, and more. Commitment to Workforce Development 
“We can and should do more. My dream would be a call to action for business leaders, to show that business can be a great platform for change. Business and government together can create world-class educational and apprenticeship programs to invest in the future of our workforce.”  —Marc Benioff, CEO, Salesforce
Inclusive by Design: Purpose-Filled Solutions 
You just learned that workforce development programs aim to help people develop new skills, and as a result create a well-trained workforce that can meet the growing demands of jobs in the future. Workforce Navigators takes this a step further by supporting Trailblazers with disabilities throughout their entire journey, ensuring accessible experiences every step of the way.
We believe that a robust and actionable workforce development program that supports professionals with disabilities includes the following elements.
•	A referral stream for professionals with disabilities seeking career advancement opportunities.
•	Accessible training and learning materials universally designed for inclusion.
•	Opportunities for paid work experience to build an individual’s resume.
By supporting professionals with disabilities through talent development, everyone can perform at their peak. We offer a network and structure to support growth through an entire career.

Workforce Navigators Benefits 
Workforce Navigators offers myriad benefits–from accessible learning content to certification and scholarship support. As a job seeker, you can take advantage of learning content presented in the way that best works for you. And if financial support is a concern, you can apply for a scholarship to assist with your learning journey.
For DEI practitioners or hiring managers, you have the opportunity to review programs that can be reapplied within your organization. And importantly, you can tap into a wealth of diverse talent to meet growing job demands. 

Workforce Navigators in Action 
Molly just started a new job at a finance firm that operates on the Salesforce platform. She uses screen magnification in combination with a screen reader to enlarge content on the screen and also have it spoken aloud. She sometimes has trouble using the mouse; she is much faster using the keyboard to get work done. This is her first time using Salesforce, and she is searching for a community where she can pick up tips and tricks while she works her way through Trailhead.
Molly has the opportunity to join Workforce Navigators for training, mentorship, and scholarships. She can also tap into the Workforce Navigators written accessibility resources like screen reader instructions and keyboard-only use.
In the next unit, we take a closer look at the three key components of Workforce Navigators.

Join the Workforce Navigators Program 
Learning Objectives  
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe three ways to participate in the Workforce Navigators program.
•	Access the Workforce Navigators website and resources.
•	Discover how you can partner with Workforce Navigators.
A Three-Tiered Approach to Support 
As you learned in the previous unit, Workforce Navigators is a workforce development program designed to support professionals with disabilities through mentorship, training, and scholarships. We take a multipronged approach to supporting job seekers with disabilities and training. There are many benefits of Workforce Navigators. Let’s explore!
Training
When you join Workforce Navigators, Salesforce learning opportunities expand and open up to you, beginning with our rigorous and disciplined training. As part of Workforce Navigators, we offer both intensive, virtual bootcamps and self-paced, online curriculums. 
Trailhead Virtual Bootcamp is a multi-week program that provides fundamental knowledge and expert-led guidance for building Salesforce skills quickly. Job seekers can join prescriptive bootcamps and learn directly from Salesforce experts through live sessions. Professionals looking to advance their career can find new opportunities and develop skills and prove their expertise by completing Trailhead badges or earning Salesforce certifications through the Bootcamp.
To meet individual needs and schedules, job seekers can also get the same hands-on learning at their own pace. This flexible, self-paced option offers access to the Salesforce organization to practice new skills, test knowledge, and review learning resources.
Scholarship Programs
To help provide access to training for individuals who may need financial assistance, each year we award Trailhead Virtual Bootcamp scholarships to skilled professionals with disabilities who meet certain requirements. To apply, fill out the scholarship application. Currently, the scholarship is only available in the US and Canada.
Mentorship Program
Everyone deserves the chance to have a mentor. That’s why Salesforce’s Office of Accessibility created a dedicated mentorship program for people with disabilities. 
Community is a key element for success, and our mentoring program can help you begin building yours. The Workforce Navigators Mentoring Program offers career support to people with disabilities who are exploring roles within the ecosystem, working toward Salesforce certification, or already certified. 
With Workforce Navigators, you learn from the best. After you sign up for the mentorship program, we assign you a Salesforce employee mentor, who can help guide you through training and information about careers at Salesforce.
Consider these mentorship benefits.
•	Meet with a trusted and skilled mentor at least 2 hours per month.
•	Share short-term and long-term career goals for insight and guidance.
•	Get actionable advice and suggestions to improve your resume.
•	Participate in mock interviews.
Currently only available in the US and Canada, check out the mentorship program page to learn about the requirements (there are just a few) and how to enroll as a mentee. 
Mentorship in Action  
Janice has self-identified with a disability and is currently living in the US. She has taken advantage of the Workforce Navigators Program and has taken virtual bootcamp sessions and recently received her admin certification. She is now interested in taking the next step: enrolling in the mentorship program and continuing to build more community with Salesforce and its ecosystem.
Janice meets the eligibility requirements to become a part of the mentorship program because she resides within the US or Canada, has a disability, and has completed her admin certification.
Even if she were still working on certification, as long as she had completed her classes, she could take advantage of the program.    
Exam Accommodations
We want trailblazers with disabilities to have the resources they need to be successful in their roles. To move into a new career, inclusion and resources are critical to ensuring your future success. That’s why we provide exam accommodations for the Salesforce Admin certification exam. Learn how to request accommodations on Trailhead Help. 
Be sure to work with your doctor ahead of time to identify what accommodations you will need before submitting your request.
Corporate and Non-Profit Partners 
Workforce Navigators relies on the partnership and cooperation of an inclusive ecosystem. The benefits of our program extend well beyond professionals with disabilities working in the Salesforce ecosystem. We partner with workforce development organizations to train, certify, and place people with disabilities. The highly skilled and trained professionals within our program provide an incredible talent pool and pipeline for companies looking to fill roles in the Salesforce ecosystem.

Build Community Through Learning and Networking 
Learning Objectives  
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Connect your company with Workforce Navigators.
•	Create a case for accessibility blockers.
•	Become part of the community of trailblazers with disabilities.
Join Our Community 
Connect
At Salesforce, we take great pride in helping pave the way to a more inclusive workforce. We recognize that fostering a more diverse and inclusive culture is a journey. Building community through individual outreach and in partnership with other companies and organizations is a key part of this journey. And it begins with individuals in the community who can help build and make connections with Workforce Navigators.
We work with workforce development organizations to train, certify, and place people with disabilities in the Salesforce ecosystem. For example, we have partnerships with nonprofits like the Blind Institute of Technology and BOSMA. The Blind Institute of Technology is a nationwide organization whose aim is to reduce the unemployment rate within the blind and visually impaired community. BOSMA is an organization that partners with businesses to create jobs and training programs for people who are blind. 
So what does “work with workforce development organizations” really mean? Let’s take a look.
Akasia Parran has been legally blind for 5 years. The unmet need in her job search was accessible technology. As part of our partnership with the Blind Institute of Technology, Akasia had the opportunity to take a course that offers professionals with disabilities the chance to gain skills for meaningful employment. 
The Salesforce free online learning modules offer enhanced accessibility features. For Akasia, that meant that she was able to complete coursework and became a certified Salesforce Administrator in just 6 months.
“I wouldn’t have a career without Salesforce’s continuing efforts to create accessible software.” —Akasia Parran
To learn more about Akasia’s story, read Breaking Accessibility Barriers and Becoming a Salesforce Pro.
As a collective whole, we know we can accomplish far more together than we ever could alone. The support we receive from our nonprofit partners helps us provide accessible accommodations across our entire Salesforce ecosystem. If you’re a professional with a disability pursuing Salesforce credentials, we want you to have the support you need to successfully complete the certification exams. 
To request an accommodation, follow the steps in this article. Be sure to work with your doctor ahead of time to identify what accommodations you need before submitting your request.
And if you’re an HR practitioner looking to establish a workforce development program of your own, contact us at workforcenavigators@salesforce.com. We’re happy to share our learnings, which you can apply in your organization.
As we mentioned, we want trailblazers with disabilities to have the resources they need to be successful in their roles. We do this by partnering with companies to upskill their employees, offering free digital training to the public, publishing resources, and more.
The Workforce navigators talent pool is strong and made up of an incredible group of highly skilled and diverse individuals. If you’d like to hire from our network, contact us at Workforce Navigators.
Partnership in Action 
Shirley is an HR manager who wants to find individuals with Salesforce certifications to fill a few open roles. And in parallel with her talent search, Shirley is building a new workforce development program to support professionals with disabilities. 
Salesforce Workforce Navigators welcomes companies who want to participate in the program and access the Workforce Navigators talent network of professionals. And HR professionals like Shirley can get information about nonprofit organizations that can help her establish training programs. She can also learn tips and approaches from the Salesforce program to apply at her company.
Remove Barriers: Pave the Way for a More Inclusive Hiring Experience 
Earlier in this unit, we mentioned that achieving inclusion and accessibility is a journey. It’s important to recognize that every company is at a different stage of development for inclusion. As a Trailblazer with a disability or an advocate for inclusion, we can all play a positive role in helping to improve the landscape. 
Any one of us can be a change agent when we encounter a barrier to success. While most barriers are likely an oversight and not an intentional exclusion, it’s up to us all to drive culture changes that remove barriers and put in place best practices.
If you feel you have experienced a barrier at any point in our hiring experience, we want to hear about it. Accessibility blockers on any software platform should be reported to the company’s accessibility team. If you find an accessibility blocker on the Salesforce platform, we welcome your feedback and have a system in place for reporting. Use this article to submit your accessibility issue and create a product accessibility support case.
It’s also important to celebrate successes and best-in-class examples of inclusion and accessibility. View our events page for information about upcoming guest lectures. If you have a great story to share about your company, contact us to see if you can become part of our series.
Next, let’s consider a scenario where an accessibility barrier prevented a professional from performing at their fullest potential. 
Accessibility Barrier Example 
Jack finds a great role posted online with a company that has a strong reputation for valuing diversity. Jack is a cybersecurity expert and has been deaf since birth. He applies online for the role and is asked to take a few online tests to move forward in the interview process. Excited to begin, he opens the first test and discovers there's a video he must watch and answer questions about. Unfortunately, the video does not have captions. He does poorly on the exam, and the results are not representative of his actual expertise and knowledge.
After he completes the test, he reaches out to his hiring contact to let them know the challenges he encountered. As it turns out, they have a version with captioning, and Jack is able to retake the test and successfully continue with the hiring process as a top candidate. And going forward, the company institutes a new policy to embed captioning into all its training videos so that new hires have the option of turning on captioning, as needed.
“Do the best you can until you know better. Then, when you know better, do better.” —Maya Angelou, American Poet
Become Part of Our Trailblazing Community 
Regardless of where you are in your career journey as a job seeker, or what roles you are looking to fill as a hiring manager, the Workforce Navigators program can give you a path to success. We can all learn together and pave a broader and deeper path for inclusion and accessibility. Let’s keep the momentum going and stay in touch to share opportunities for learning and career advancement while playing a part in fostering a culture of inclusion.

Guard Data Transmission 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Define transport layer security (TLS). 
•	Identify how public key infrastructure (PKI) secures data transmission. 
Encrypting Data Transmission with TLS
One critical link in securing data transmission is to use transport layer security (TLS) to encrypt it. TLS is a cryptographic protocol designed to secure communications over a computer network. A protocol describes how the cryptographic algorithms should be used to secure information. Cryptographic protocols are used to secure transferred messages during application-level data transport. They are widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). But their use as the security layer in Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) remains the most publicly visible instance for secure web browsing. 
Using a PKI Service
Many organizations use internal services to simplify the process of getting certificates for TLS. If your organization has such a service, you should use it for provisioning and delivering the short-lived certificates to hosts and services upon which TLS relies. If your organization does not have an internal service, you should consider planning for or adopting a public key infrastructure (PKI) service. A PKI service simplifies the process of encryption by setting up a system for acquiring the certificates that TLS uses to authenticate identity. 
Let’s start by looking at how a PKI service works. PKI is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. Digital certificates establish your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the web. They are issued by a certification authority (CA) who vouches for their authenticity.  
In cryptography, a PKI is an arrangement that binds public keys with respective identities of entities (like people and organizations). A public key is the key your web browser uses to encrypt or scramble data into ciphertext, which is sent to a website. The data is then decrypted with a private key held by the entity that is authorized to view the data. The binding is established through a process of registration and issuance of certificates at and by a CA. A CA confirms the validity of a website's certificate and, therefore, verifies that the website itself is valid.  
 
In general, PKI provides “trust services.” Trust services is the process of ensuring the electronic identification of signatories and services. Trust service objectives respect one or more of the following capabilities: confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. 
Confidentiality: Ensures that no entity can maliciously or unwittingly view your data in cleartext. Data is encrypted to make it secret so that even if it is read, it appears as gibberish. This is why the most common use of PKI for confidentiality purposes is in the context of TLS. 
Integrity: Ensures that if transmitted data is tampered with in any way, there is clear evidence that it happened. This traceability is a key trust objective of PKI systems. 
Authenticity: Ensures that you have connection certainty for authentication of data in transit on both the server-side and the client-side of the transmission. 
These trust services are why organizations use PKI services to generate certificates for data encryption over TLS. A certificate service is basically an organization of services surrounding a CA that allows it to issue, renew, and revoke certificates. Certificates are what pass a public key to computers that need to communicate securely using the PKI system. 
Your organization most likely has its own customized PKI service to generate the certificates you need to securely encrypt your data in transit using TLS. You should use that system to encrypt data in transit, so that you do not risk exposing yourself and your organization to attackers on the open internet who might wish to do you harm.

Encrypt Data at Rest 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Define the risks to data at rest. 
•	Explain encryption best practices to protect data at rest. 
What Is Data at Rest?
Data at rest is the data housed on computer data storage in any digital form, whether it's in cloud storage, file hosting services, or databases. Data at rest can even include physical data stored in warehouses, spreadsheets, archives, or tapes. For the purposes of this module, data refers to electronic data.  
Depending on the core business of your organization, data at rest can be one of the most valuable assets you have. That’s why this type of data is subject to threats from attackers. To prevent this data from being accessed or stolen, organizations often employ security protection measures such as password protection, data encryption, or a combination of both. Let’s take a closer look at encryption of data at rest.  
 
Use Encryption to Secure Organization Data at Rest
Just as it’s crucial to encrypt data in transit, it’s also important to encrypt sensitive data at rest. This is to ensure that you handle private data securely, and that it stays private. Your goal when encrypting data at rest should be to implement a solution that prevents data visibility in the event of unauthorized access or theft.  
When protecting data at rest, you want to make sure that encrypted data remains encrypted when other controls fail. Sometimes this is done by combining network segmentation and increasing levels of encryption. Encrypting data on multiple levels is a good way to enhance its safety.  
At a minimum, you should:  
•	Implement cryptography on the database housing the data and on the physical devices where the databases are stored. 
•	Update data encryption keys on a regular basis. 
•	Store encryption keys separately from the data. 
•	Enable crypto-shredding at the end of the data or hardware lifecycle. 
•	Audit sensitive data at scheduled intervals. 
•	Store only the minimum amount of sensitive data. 
While there are many ways to configure encrypted data at rest systems, here are some basic best practices. 
Asymmetric cryptography (also known as public-key encryption) uses the difficulty of certain math problems to give you a pair of keys, each of which can be used to encrypt a message so that only the other key in the pair can decrypt it. That means anyone can use the public key to hide something, and only the holders of the private key can unlock it. The holders of the private key can also “sign” any message, and anyone in the world can use the public key to verify it was really signed by them.  
Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption as it uses two keys for the process. In a symmetric key system, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, while in an asymmetric system, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret. Asymmetric cryptography tools include authentication tokens, Docker or Java’s JCA.   
Hardware security module (HSM) is hardware that holds private keys and it can be used without disclosing them. While it's running, you can put public-key encrypted information on one end and get decrypted information out of the other, and nobody can ever discover the private key.  
Defense in depth means applying controls at different layers of your technology stack so that you don’t rely on just one control to protect your data. One way to implement defense in depth when it comes to encryption is to combine your encryption capabilities with asymmetric cryptography and HSM. This means that even if parts of the system are compromised, it is still difficult to access all the data.  
Strong encryption methods include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA). These are both encryption standards used by governments, technology companies, and other organizations. The difference between them is that AES is a symmetric key system, and RSA is an asymmetric key system. This means that AES uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while RSA uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt data.  
Sum It Up
In this module, you’ve learned more about protecting data transmission with TLS and PKI, and encrypting data at rest. Using these methods across the board minimizes the chance that attackers can access it. You can learn more about best practices in cybersecurity from real security practitioners by visiting the Cybersecurity Learning Hub on Trailhead.

Safeguard Production Secrets 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Define key management solutions (KMS).
•	Explain the value of using a KMS.
•	Identify KMS methodologies.
•	Define key management terms.
What Is a Key Management Solution? 
Key management solutions (KMS) rely on a set of dedicated servers to administer a full lifecycle of cryptographic keys (keys used to encrypt data) and protect them from loss or misuse. KMS and other key management technologies ultimately control the generation, usage, storage, archival, and deletion of encryption keys. Additionally, to fully protect their loss or misuse, companies must limit access to these keys, either by restricting physical access or controlling user access by creating clear and defined user roles.
Data encryption is the bedrock of cybersecurity. Encrypted data remains worthless ciphertext (encrypted or encoded text that is unreadable by humans or computers) to anyone who doesn't have access to the encryption keys. So, key management is—in turn—the key to encrypted data security. 
Keys unlock your secrets, which means they pose a specific security risk if accessed by an unauthorized user. Somehow, you must keep track of the keys, decide who has access to them, and figure out how they can be accessed without being exposed. This is the central task of any KMS.
Why KMS? 
KMS is designed to provide application owners a way to generate and manage cryptographic keys. These keys should be protected and managed in a secure and physical computing device—a hardware security module (HSM)—when possible. HSMs are designed and certified to be tamper-evident and intrusion-resistant, and they provide the highest level of physical security.
A common mistake people make when encrypting data at rest is to use an inadequate key, or to store the key along with the encrypted data. This is the equivalent of leaving a key under the doormat of your house. It’s the first place a malicious actor looks for a key, and it puts your data in serious danger. Instead, make sure that keys only exist on devices in a transient state. That is, the user should enter them only so that the data can be decrypted and then erased from memory. 
 
KMS Methodologies 
There are various KMS methodologies that centralize key generation, distribution, and management. These allow you to maintain control of what keys are in use and who is using them.
Traditional Public-Key Solutions
One reason keys have been difficult to manage is that in a traditional public-key solution, a key is typically assigned to an individual, server, or organization. This key works like a signature, validating that the data has come from the proper source. In this technology solution, keypairs persist for years at a time, so the key must be carefully guarded against disclosure. Anyone with access to the private key can counterfeit that person's digital signature. 
Transient-Key Solutions
In transient-key solutions, the keypair is assigned to a brief interval of time, not to a particular person or entity. Data signed by a specific private key becomes associated with a specific time and date. A keypair is active only for a few minutes, after which the private key is permanently destroyed. Therefore, unlike public-key solutions, transient-key solutions do not depend upon the long-term security of the private keys. A KMS works as a transient-key solution. Larger organizations use a KMS with an HSM to provide a very high level of security.
Key Management Terms 
Let’s talk about some cryptographic key terms you might encounter when working with KMS solutions. 
Password versus key: In Secrets Management for Developers, you learned about the difference between a password and a key. Remember that the primary difference between keys and passwords is that the latter are intended to be generated, read, remembered, and reproduced by a human user. A key, by contrast, is intended for use by the software that is implementing the cryptographic algorithm, so human readability is not required. In fact, most users will, in most cases, be unaware of the existence of the keys being used on their behalf by the security components of their everyday software applications.
Symmetric versus asymmetric keys: Asymmetric key algorithms use separate keys for encryption and decryption, while symmetric key algorithms use a single key for both processes. Because an asymmetric algorithm uses multiple keys, the process takes longer to produce than a symmetric key algorithm does. However, the benefit is that an asymmetric algorithm is much more secure than a symmetric key algorithm.
Cryptographic hash: This is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size (the hash value, hash, or message digest). Hashing is a cryptographic process that can be used to validate the authenticity and integrity of various types of input. It is widely used in authentication systems to avoid storing plaintext passwords in databases, but is also used to validate files, documents and other types of data.
Cryptographic salt: This is the random data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password, or a passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage.
A KMS solution protects your secrets as follows: A developer uses KMS to create or store a secret using the KMS producer service. The producer generates a new secret, embeds authorization by attaching the set of services that are allowed to access it, and encrypts it. The developer receives the resulting encrypted blob to check-in to source control along with their application. The encrypted secret is deployed to production along with the application, where it is decrypted and exposed to code via an in-memory file system.

Manage Your Keys 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Define the key management lifecycle.
•	Explain the different approaches to key management solutions (KMS).
Key Management Lifecycle 
Now that you’ve learned how to keep your production secrets safe, let’s talk about the key management lifecycle and why it’s equally important for security. While there are many phases to this lifecycle, key management focuses on creating, maintaining, securing, and controlling the use of cryptographic keys. Monitoring this process allows you to assure that the keys are properly created and deployed. There are four phases to the key management lifecycle, which are important to securing production secrets. 
1.	Key Creation and Activation
2.	Key Revocation
3.	Key Escrow (Backup)
4.	Key Deletion (Destruction)
Let’s take a closer look at each.
Key Creation and Activation
A key manager creates the encryption key and stores it in a key storage database along with its attributes: name, activation date, size, and so forth. You can activate keys at creation or set them to activate later.
Key Revocation
Any key administrator can use the key manager to revoke a key. This places the key in an invalidated state and it can no longer be used for cryptographic purposes like encryption and decryption. If needed, you can reactivate revoked keys. An example of this may be when an old key is required to decrypt data previously encrypted with it.
Key Escrow (Backup)
Key escrow allows for keys to be securely archived when they deactivate. Much like key revocation, you can reactivate archived keys if required. 
Key Deletion (Destruction)
When a key is no longer necessary or has become compromised, an admin may choose to delete it from the storage database. This removes all or certain instances from the database, making recovery impossible (outside of any stored backups). Should a key become compromised, an admin can immediately delete it, allowing your data to remain secure. 
KMS Strategies 
An organization can take one of several different approaches when it comes to key management strategies: decentralized, distributed, or centralized.
Manage Your Keys—Decentralized (Local)
A decentralized key management solution (DKMS) or local key management is an approach to key management where no central authority exists. Individuals bear all the responsibility for creating, securing, managing, and destroying cryptographic keys. An example of this is local backup encryption or a local file vault on a computer.
Manage Your Keys—Distributed (Siloed)
Another approach is to use a distributed or siloed key management approach, where you consolidate the management for a particular application or system. A common example of this is full disk encryption that is used in large enterprise organizations. The keys for the disk encryption are all managed by a central application that is used specifically for that one purpose.
Manage Your Keys—Centralized
There is also the option of using a dedicated and centralized KMS (CKMS). Distributed key management solutions become increasingly difficult to manage as your company grows. A CKMS can unify key management across your entire company allowing for scale with the needs of the business. Benefits of a CKMS include providing tamper-evident records for proof of compliance along with streamlining key management processes, automatic key updates, and backup and recovery options. 
It’s important to note that all of the above methods are available within the cloud, as well as your company’s on-premise system for key management. However, if scalability, auditing, and security are of high concern, CKMS is ideal. By managing keys in a centralized fashion, you reduce operational burdens and associated costs, while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of your keys.

Implement Mobile Application Security 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Identify the Open Web Application Security Project’s mobile security resources.
•	List actions to address improper platform usage.
•	Describe how to mitigate insecure data storage, communication, and authentication.
•	Explain the risk associated with insufficient cryptography.
Before You Start 
If you completed the Mobile Application Security module, then you already know about the mobile application (app) landscape and key skills relevant to mobile application security (appsec) engineering. Now let’s talk about how to leverage the Open Web Application Security Project’s (OWASP’s) mobile security resources to help you address mobile security risks.
OWASP’s Mobile Security Resources 
OWASP® is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of applications (apps) and software by providing guidelines through local and global conferences and open source software projects. These include the OWASP Mobile Top 10 project, web app project, application programming interface (API) security project, serverless computing project, and much more. In this module, we use the OWASP Mobile Top 10 as a framework to explain the way to implement mobile appsec.
As a mobile application security (appsec) engineer, your challenge is to secure an ever-growing and constantly updating mobile app portfolio with finite resources. Thankfully, you can standardize and scale mobile appsec testing using the OWASP Mobile Security Project. The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralized resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile apps. You can use the OWASP’s mobile security resources to build efficient and effective mobile appsec programs. Let’s take a quick look at some of the OWASP’s mobile security resources.
OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard 
The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is a standard for mobile appsec. As a mobile appsec engineer, you can use the MASVS to develop more secure apps, and to ensure completeness and consistency of security test results. The goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation. The MASVS maps directly to the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG). 
OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide
The OWASP MSTG is a project that seeks to define the industry standard for mobile appsec. It covers the processes, techniques, and tools you can use during a mobile appsec test, and an exhaustive set of test cases that enables you to deliver consistent and complete test results. The OWASP MSTG is a comprehensive manual for mobile appsec testing and reverse engineering for iOS and Android mobile security testers.
OWASP Mobile Top 10
The OWASP Mobile Top 10 list is a great resource for mobile appsec engineers who want to design and secure mobile apps, because many of them are inherently vulnerable to security risks. The OWASP Mobile Top 10 is a mobile security project focused on highlighting security vulnerabilities in mobile apps and the remediation strategies to mitigate the risk associated with them. This list sheds light on technical threats and highlights the risk to the business. Note that this list only covers some of the potential vulnerabilities that can be present in a mobile application and it is not comprehensive. 
Here are the OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks.
•	M1: Improper Platform Usage
•	M2: Insecure Data Storage
•	M3: Insecure Communication
•	M4: Insecure Authentication
•	M5: Insufficient Cryptography
•	M6: Insecure Authorization
•	M7: Poor Code Quality
•	M8: Code Tampering
•	M9: Reverse Engineering
•	M10: Extraneous Functionality
Manage Security Risks with the OWASP Mobile Top 10 
Let’s take a look at how you, as a mobile appsec engineer, can use the OWASP Mobile Top 10 to help better manage security risks in your mobile apps.
Angeli is an Android operating system (OS) mobile appsec engineer at a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise mobile apps to manage business operations and customer relations.
 
Angeli has been tasked with using the OWASP Mobile Top 10 to evaluate her organization’s mobile apps and verify that they’re secure. Let’s follow along as she does so.
 
The scenarios below describe examples of each risk but do not represent an exhaustive list of issues that could occur under each risk.
M1: Improper Platform Usage
This risk covers the misuse of a mobile OS feature or a failure to use platform security controls properly. It might include Android intents, platform permissions, misuse of biometric authentication mechanisms, password storage tools, or some other security control that’s part of the mobile OS.
During the evaluation of several of her company’s Android apps, Angeli notices that many of them are storing cryptographic keys on the file system. Because cryptographic keys are commonly used to secure particularly sensitive data they are a primary target for attackers.
An unauthorized user could use a variety of attacks to read the keys from the file system. Angeli knows that storing cryptographic material on the standard file system is against Android’s best practices and that her organization is at risk of improper platform usage. She circles back with the development team to help them implement a solution using the Android keystore system to store the cryptographic keys as securely as possible.
M2: Insecure Data Storage
This risk covers a case where an adversary attains a lost or stolen mobile device or executes malware or another repackaged app on the mobile device. Angeli evaluates the organization’s apps for this risk, and realizes that an app is storing usernames and credentials in plain text in system logs.
She circles back with the application development team to see if they performed a threat model on the app prior to release, in order to identify insecure storage as a possible risk. Noticing they did not perform one, she recommends that the application development manager incorporate threat modeling into the development process so that these bugs are identified before release.
Angeli further recommends that the development team identify sensitive data that the app processes, stores, or transmits, and validate that the data isn’t unnecessarily exposed. Lastly, Angeli informs the development team to create and implement a plan as soon as possible for remediating and redeploying the mobile app. Angeli works with the development team to perform a root cause analysis to uncover why the vulnerability was not identified before deployment.
M3: Insecure Communication
This risk covers a case where a threat agent might exploit vulnerabilities to intercept sensitive data while it’s traversing the mobile device’s carrier network and the internet. This can occur if an adversary compromises or monitors your local Wi-Fi network, or if there’s malware on your mobile device capturing the sensitive data in transit.
In evaluating her organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli realizes that one of the apps fails to verify that the certificate offered is valid, and instead unconditionally accepts any certificate offered to it by the server. This destroys any mutual authentication capability between the mobile app and the endpoint, and leaves the app vulnerable to manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through a transport layer security (TLS) proxy.
An MITM attack occurs when a perpetrator positions themselves in a conversation between two parties, such as a user and an application. The intention is to either eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties by making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway and capturing sensitive data.
To address this risk, Angeli works with the app development team to ensure the app only establishes a secure connection after verifying the identity of the endpoint server using trusted certificates in the keystore.
M4: Insecure Authentication
This risk covers a case where a threat agent exploits authentication vulnerabilities through attacks that use available or custom-built tools. In evaluating the organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli realizes that an app uses a weak password configuration policy to simplify how the user enters a password. She works with the application development team to replace the 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) currently allowed as an authentication credential with a stronger authentication mechanism, to make it more difficult for adversaries to deduce the password.
M5: Insufficient Cryptography
This risk covers a case where a threat agent has physical access to data that’s been encrypted improperly, or uses mobile malware to take advantage of insufficient encryption on a mobile device. In evaluating her organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli discovers that an app uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which has been shown to have significant weaknesses. She works with the application development team to re-engineer the app to instead follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines on recommended algorithms.
Sum It Up 
Angeli’s organization is on the road to having more secure apps—but her work here isn’t done. In the next unit, find out how Angeli protects her organization’s apps against the rest of the Mobile Top 10.

Address Mobile Application Risks 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Describe how to address insecure authorization. 
•	List actions to improve code quality. 
•	Explain how to mitigate code tampering. 
•	Identify reverse engineering risks. 
•	Describe how to prevent extraneous functionality risks. 
Address Mobile Risks
Let’s continue to follow Angeli as she works to secure her organization’s mobile apps, using the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Mobile Top 10 as a guide. 
M6: Insecure Authorization 
This risk covers a case where a threat agent exploits authorization vulnerabilities through attacks that use available or custom-built tools. It’s important to recognize the difference between authentication and authorization. Authentication is the act of identifying an individual. Authorization is the act of confirming that the identified individual has the permissions necessary to perform the act. The two are closely related, as authorization checks should always immediately follow authentication of an incoming request from a mobile device. 
Upon inspecting the organization’s applications (apps) carefully, Angeli discovers that authorization decisions are being executed locally on the client-side of the mobile app during the authentication request. This could lead to a situation where an adversary could tweak an incoming request and masquerade as a member of a group they don’t belong to, to gain access to administrative functionality. 
Angeli works with the developers to update the app to authorize the roles and permissions of authenticated users using only information contained in back-end systems. She reminds them it’s important to avoid relying on any roles or permission information that comes from the mobile device itself. 
 
M7: Poor Code Quality 
This risk covers the case where a threat agent passes untrusted inputs to method calls (operators used to call self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task) made within mobile code. Threat actors typically exploit these poor code quality issues via malware or phishing scams. 
Working with the mobile app pen testing team, Angeli learns that the team has been able to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in one of the organization’s apps. The exploit allows them to write into areas known to hold executable code and replace it with malicious code. She works with the development team to reengineer the code by marking certain regions within the code as nonexecutable—a technique known as executable space protection. They also implement bounds checking to automatically check that data written to a buffer is within acceptable boundaries. Finally, Angeli works with the team to implement an automated process to identify future buffer overflows through the use of third-party static analysis tools. 
M8: Code Tampering 
This risk covers the case where the organization’s apps do not implement code signing. The lack of code signing allows an attacker to tamper with the app’s code. Typically, this attack occurs when an attacker tweaks a legitimate app’s code after downloading it from a popular app store. The attacker modifies the app to include malicious code then uploads it to a lesser known third-party app store, where an unsuspecting user downloads it. 
Angeli discovers that an attacker has created a counterfeit version of one of her organization’s apps. The counterfeit version captures and transmits the user’s personally identifiable information (PII), along with their username/password, to a third-party site. This allows the attacker to use the information for fraudulent purposes. 
Angeli contacts both app stores to inform them of the fraudulent use. She provides her app’s signature (distinctive, pattern-based detection methods which use expressions or marks for identifying app traffic), so the store can verify that her company is the legal owner of the app. They remove the unauthorized copies of the app from their stores, replacing it with the signed version. Angeli puts in place a plan to continually monitor the major app stores to check for any new unauthorized versions that have been published, and to submit new reclaiming requests on a regular basis. 
M9: Reverse Engineering 
This risk covers the case where an attacker downloads the targeted app from an app store and analyzes it within their own local environment using a suite of different tools to see how it works. The attacker uses reverse engineering to reveal sensitive and unencrypted information about back-end servers, cryptographic constants and ciphers, intellectual property, and more. 
Working with the mobile app pen testing team to evaluate one of the organization’s apps, Angeli discovers that an attacker would be able to run strings against the unencrypted app and find a hard-coded connection string that contains authentication credentials to a back-end database. An attacker could use those credentials to gain access to the database and steal PII data about the app’s users. Angeli consults with the development team on a remediation, and they decide to remove the hard-coded connection string and replace the functionality with a server side access controlled API to provide the required data to the application. 
M10: Extraneous Functionality 
This risk covers the case where an attacker seeks to understand extraneous functionalities or unnecessary components within a mobile app to discover hidden functionality in back-end systems. The attacker can typically exploit extraneous functionality directly from their own systems without any involvement by end users. 
Working with the organization's pen testing team, Angeli discovers that the mobile app developers included backdoor functionality in one of the organization’s apps that was not intended for release into production environments. An attacker could discover this functionality and use it to execute back-end administrative functions. To prevent this from happening in the future, Angeli works with her organization to implement manual, secure code reviews using subject matter experts most knowledgeable with this code. 
The subject matter experts make sure to examine the app’s configuration settings to discover any hidden switches, remove test code from the final production release, and examine all application programming interface (API) endpoints accessed by the mobile app to verify that they’re well documented and publicly available. They also examine log statements to ensure nothing overly descriptive about the back end is being written to the logs. Thanks to the OWASP Mobile Top 10, Angeli’s organization is now much more secure.

Test Mobile Applications 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Identify the differences between static application security testing and dynamic application security testing.
•	Define interactive application security testing and runtime application self-protection.
Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing 
As mobile applications (apps) continue to grow as an attack vector, your organization should prioritize mobile application security (appsec) to fortify its overall security posture. Adversaries employ both static attacks based on source code itself and dynamic attacks that exploit app functionality. Understanding and remediating mobile app vulnerabilities in your code is vital for your mobile appsec program.
Mobile appsec testing is the process of analyzing mobile apps to find security weaknesses, such as misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. Testing your apps regularly decreases the chance of vulnerabilities occuring or being exploited. Static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) are the most popular evaluation techniques available to you in order to secure mobile apps during the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
Static Application Security Testing 
SAST is about the prevention of defects, whereas DAST is about finding and fixing the defects. While you perform SAST testing in the early stages of the SDLC, before deploying code into production environments, you perform DAST later in the lifecycle. Static and dynamic testing complement one another, and each type has a distinct approach to detecting bugs.
You use SAST to analyze source code for known vulnerabilities as a form of white-box testing that scans and analyzes source code at rest from the inside out. SAST is programming-language dependent. You perform SAST to check the defects in software without actually executing the code of the mobile app. SAST tooling scans the source code looking for potentially vulnerable patterns and provides a list of results that then are triaged to weed out false positives. A false positive is a mislabeled security vulnerability indicating there is a threat when, in actuality, there isn't.
 
SAST is often referred to as verification: the evaluation of the development process. Though the most mature and easiest to deploy of the appsec testing tools, SAST scans are slow and often prone to high false-positive rates when identifying potential vulnerabilities. 
Dynamic Application Security Testing
DAST is a form of black-box testing you perform by executing the mobile app’s code. You use it to look for vulnerabilities by simulating external attacks on an application while it runs in a test environment. You use DAST to penetrate an application from the outside by checking its exposed interfaces for weaknesses. 
In DAST, you work with the actual mobile app, not some artifact or model that represents the system. You provide an input, receive output, and compare the output to the expected behavior. You use test cases for testing processes and study how the code behaves during execution. DAST is often referred to as validation: the evaluation of a finished product. You do this testing as one of the last steps before deployment in a test environment, and after code deployment. As a result, fixing problems at this stage becomes more expensive because the product is actively in use.
DAST is programming-language agnostic and is a good method for preventing regressions. However, it’s hard to automate and scale because you need experienced security professionals to tailor these test tools to specific use cases, making it more difficult to create a comprehensive testing strategy for each app. DAST also cannot pinpoint the exact source of the problem (for example, the line of code). Furthermore, it can generate a lot of false positives. 
Examples of methodologies for dynamic testing are unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
•	Unit Testing: Testing of individual modules by developers
•	Integration Testing: Testing the interface between different modules when they are joined
•	System Testing: Testing performed on the system as a whole
•	Acceptance Testing: Testing done from the user’s point of view
The following table summarizes the differences between SAST and DAST. 
Attribute	SAST	DAST
Execution	Happens without the execution of code	Involves execution of the code
Examination	Examines code manually or with an SAST tool	Examines code by giving a set of inputs to see if the output matches the expected results
Time	Occurs early on throughout the development of the product	Happens after the product has been developed
Types of Defects	Detects missing requirements, design defects, syntax errors, and more	Detects if output matches the expected values
Testing Techniques	Involves informal reviews, technical reviews, walkthroughs, inspections, and static code reviews	Involves unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing
Type	Prevention	Cure
Cost	Is more cost effective	Is comparatively more expensive
While both tools have their advantages and disadvantages, using them in tandem—along with interactive application security testing (IAST) and runtime application self-protection (RASP)—helps strengthen your app’s security, one testing technique at a time. Let’s take a look! 
Interactive Application Security Testing and Runtime Application Self-Protection 
Interactive Application Security Testing
SAST and DAST only provide a snapshot in time of a mobile app’s security weaknesses. These tools alone can’t keep up with today’s agile SDLC processes. This means that development, operations, and security teams are often one step behind as they develop, test, and transition software into production environments. To make it easier for businesses, appsec tool manufacturers realized that SAST and DAST techniques could be merged together to create better, more efficient tools that would include the advantages of both. This is how interactive application security testing (IAST) was born.
IAST analyzes code for security vulnerabilities while the app is run by an automated test, human tester, or any activity “interacting” with the app functionality. While DAST provides an outside perspective on the app before it goes live, IAST uses software instrumentation (an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance and diagnose errors) to analyze running apps.
IAST techniques cover more code, produce better results, and verify a broader range of security rules faster than either SAST or DAST tools working alone. IAST solutions deploy agents and sensors in running apps and continuously analyze all app interactions initiated by manual tests, automated tests, or a combination of both, to identify vulnerabilities in real time. If a vulnerability is detected, the tester or testing team is notified.
This analysis allows developers to pinpoint the source of an identified vulnerability and fix it quickly. IAST also produces less false positives and false negatives (misidentified security vulnerabilities that claim you don’t have vulnerability when you do) than SAST and DAST, decreasing the workload on scarce security resources and making it easier to identify the most critical flaws.
IAST tools are not confined to a particular phase of the SDLC. Even though they deliver a lot of value during the development phase, because they help developers fix risks in real time, IAST tools are incredibly useful during the testing phase as well. They’re also valuable when the system is in production, because operations and appsec teams can benefit from the risk detection, with little performance hit and little risk of false positives. While IAST tools can provide good benefits, they also are more complex to implement correctly and require mature security development practices and comprehensive build integration in order to recognize their benefits.
Runtime Application Self-Protection
While IAST monitors an app for security vulnerabilities while it’s running, runtime application self-protection (RASP) monitors an app to detect and prevent fraudulent activities even before it runs, effectively protecting the app from both known and unknown (zero-day) attack vectors. You can use RASP to gain insight into an app's internal data and state, and identify threats at runtime that may have otherwise been overlooked by other security solutions. When an app begins to run, RASP can protect it from malicious input or behavior by analyzing both the app's behavior and the context of that behavior.
One advantage of RASP is that it requires minimal intervention of an administrator during deployment. When a security event in an app occurs, RASP takes control of the app and addresses the problem. In diagnostic mode, RASP will simply sound an alarm that something is amiss. In protection mode, it will try to stop it. For this reason, RASP can be beneficial to businesses with lean security resources because it can automatically block attacks on the spot without the need for human intervention. It’s important to first implement RASP in diagnostic mode, to observe how the tool makes decisions, before implementing protection mode.
You likely use other technologies such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and web application firewalls (WAF) to protect your apps at runtime, but these technologies work in-line as they inspect network traffic and content. Although they analyze traffic and user sessions to and from apps, they cannot see how traffic and data are being processed within apps themselves. Additionally, instead of analyzing preset signatures or known patterns based on commonly known attacks, as a WAF would, you can use RASP to look for suspicious actions taking place in the app. 
Sum It Up 
You now have a better understanding of how to use SAST, DAST, IAST, and RASP to test and secure your mobile apps.
Next, let’s turn to how to use network and mobile app penetration testing (pen testing) to further secure them.

Implement Network and Mobile Application Pen Testing 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Explain network testing.
•	Describe mobile application penetration testing.
Network Testing 
Mobile devices regularly connect to a variety of networks, including public Wi-Fi networks shared with other (potentially malicious) clients. This creates opportunities for a wide variety of network-based attacks ranging from simple to complex and old to new. Therefore, it’s vital to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information exchanged between the mobile application (app) and remote service endpoints. 
One best practice is to verify your mobile app sets up a secure, encrypted channel for network communication using the latest version of transport layer security (TLS) protocol with appropriate settings.
Network security specialists, pen testers, and mobile application security (appsec) engineers conduct regular pen testing and vulnerability checks to enable smooth and secure functioning of mobile apps. They test how the app performs under various network types, connection speeds, and quality levels including slow and interrupted connections. They also attempt to circumvent the security of the app by trying to exploit the app’s functionality through pen testing.
Mobile Application Pen Testing 
A mobile app pen test emulates an attack specifically targeting a custom mobile app and aims to enumerate all vulnerabilities within the app. Pen testing can be used across the entire spectrum of an IT infrastructure, including network, web application, and database. But today, we also see pen testing used widely for another segment: mobile appsec.

You perform pen tests of mobile apps for security vulnerabilities by using either manual or automated techniques to analyze the app. You use these techniques to identify security flaws that may occur in the mobile app. Your purpose in pen testing is to ensure that the mobile app is not vulnerable to attack and that mitigations are in place to prevent exploitation.
Pen testing requires a diligent effort to find weaknesses, just like an attacker would. You perform deep-dive testing into local on-device security issues, back-end web services, and the application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect them. You customize assessments to specific concerns, such as reverse engineering an iOS app or malware threats to an Android app. 
During pen testing, you simulate multiple attack vectors and risks, including insecure storage, stolen device risk, mobile malware attacks, and both authenticated and unauthenticated app users. By conducting pen testing, you can gain insights into the application’s vulnerabilities, bottlenecks, and attack vectors before an adversary is able to discover and exploit them. This way, once you identify an app’s shortcomings, your developers can put in fixes to plug these gaps and change the design to address the issues at hand.
Broadly speaking, mobile app pen testing methodologies include the following stages.
1.	Discovery: You gather information, which will further form the basis of the pen testing phases.
2.	Assessment and analysis: You assess the app using static application security testing (SAST), reverse engineering, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and more.
3.	Exploitation: You find hidden cues which can successfully shed light on different vulnerabilities.
4.	Reporting: You report the findings via technical reports and executive-level papers.
Sum It Up 
In this module, you’ve been introduced to the OWASP Mobile Top 10 as a way to identify and mitigate mobile appsec risks. You’ve also learned how to test mobile apps using a variety of techniques.
Along with the information you reviewed in the Mobile Application Security module, you should now have a better understanding of what it takes to be a mobile appsec engineer. You can learn more about the in-demand cybersecurity skills needed to get a job in mobile appsec, or another field, and learn more from real security practitioners by visiting the Cybersecurity Learning Hub on Trailhead.

Score Risks 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Identify information assets, Safeguards, and vulnerabilities.
•	Evaluate current Safeguard Maturity.
•	Describe how the Center for Internet Security, Inc.’s (CIS®) Risk Assessment Method (RAM) automatically scores risks.
 
This module was produced in collaboration with the CIS. Learn more about partner content on Trailhead.
Before You Start 
If you completed The Center for Internet Security's Risk Assessment Method module, then you already know how to develop Risk Assessment and Acceptance Criteria. Now let’s talk about how to use the Center for Internet Security, Inc.’s (CIS) Risk Assessment Method (RAM) to model and evaluate risks and recommend and evaluate CIS Safeguards.
 
Throughout this module, we capitalize common words when referring to a specific component of CIS RAM Version 2.1.
Identify Information Assets, Safeguards, and Vulnerabilities 
As a cybersecurity risk manager, you can model risks by associating information assets with the CIS Safeguards that protect them, the vulnerabilities that may be present, and the threats that can compromise these information assets. CIS RAM helps analyze risk by describing the component steps regardless of sequence.
•	Identify an information asset or asset class, such as a specific firewall or a set of similarly managed firewalls, an application, or a set of identically configured servers, and more.
•	Identify threats that can compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of those information assets or Asset Classes.
•	List CIS Safeguards that protect the information asset or Asset Class against foreseeable threats.
•	Indicate if you have implemented the CIS Safeguards in the environment and how you have implemented them.
•	Consider any vulnerabilities that may exist related to each Safeguard and Asset Class. You, as a cybersecurity risk manager, should take care to consider what can go wrong, even if you have implemented Safeguards. Safeguards can have vulnerabilities such as errors in administration, new threats, intentional harm, failed systems, and insufficient skills or resources.
Let’s check in with Sean, the risk assessor at Custom Car Company (CCC), as he continues to fill out his Risk Register in CIS RAM for Implementation Group 2 (IG2) Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook.
 
Using the workbook, Sean first selects an Asset Class such as Enterprise, Devices, Applications, Data, Network, or Users. 
Next, he describes the Asset Name. He selects the CIS Safeguard # and Title that applies to the Asset Class he selected. He then documents how CCC has implemented that Safeguard, including optionally adding Evidence of Implementation, and states any Vulnerabilities that may be exploited by a threat. 
 
This table represents just a few examples of the information Sean inputs. 
Asset Class	Applications	Applications	Applications
Asset Name	CarCore	CarCore	CarCore
CIS Safeguard #	2.1	2.2	2.3
CIS Safeguard Title	Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory	Ensure Authorized Software is Currently Supported 	Address Unauthorized Software 
Our Implementation	We use a software asset management tool that monitors for applications installed on all servers and end-user systems.	A software asset management tool validates that installed applications are currently supported and that the organization implements current versions.	The software asset management tool identifies installed applications that were not permitted and alerts the Operations (Ops) team. The Ops team removes unapproved applications within 5 business days.
Vulnerabilities	We track the deployment of installed software (including type, version, and patches); however, we have no method to automatically scan, download, and deploy vendor-specific patches.	None observed.	Users have administrative rights to install software on their laptops, but we don’t enforce security reviews on that software before installation.
Now that Sean has documented CCC’s assets, associated CIS Safeguards, and Vulnerabiliites, he next turns to evaluate the current maturity of CIS Safeguards at CCC.
Evaluate Current Safeguard Maturity 
As the next step in evaluating risks, Sean selects a score of 1 through 5 designating the reliability of each Safeguard’s effectiveness against threats, using the following definitions. 
1.	He did not implement the Safeguard, or implemented it inconsistently.
2.	He implemented the Safeguard  fully on some assets, or partially on all assets.
3.	He implemented the Safeguard on all assets.
4.	He tested the Safeguard and corrected inconsistencies.
5.	He has put in place mechanisms for the Safeguard to ensure consistent implementation over time.
He populates the Safeguard Maturity Score column in the risk register with his selections.
Asset Class	Applications	Applications	Applications
Asset Name	CarCore	CarCore	CarCore
CIS Safeguard #	2.1	2.2	2.3
CIS Safeguard Title	Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory	Ensure Authorized Software is Currently Supported 	Address Unauthorized Software 
Our Implementation	We use a software asset management tool that monitors for applications installed on all servers and end-user systems.	The software asset management tool validates that installed applications are currently supported and that the organization has implemented current versions.

Vulnerabilities	We track the deployment of installed software (including type, version, and patches); however, we have no method to automatically scan, download, and deploy vendor-specific patches.	None observed	Users have administrative rights to install software on their laptops, but we don’t enforce security reviews on that software before installation.
Safeguard Maturity Score	3	5	4
Automatically Score Risks 
The VERIS Community Database Index
Sean now has documented CCC’s assets, their associated Vulnerabilities, and the maturity of CCC’s current CIS Safeguard implementation in protecting against those Vulnerabilities.
CIS RAM Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook automatically calculates a value to represent how commonly a related threat causes reported cybersecurity incidents. The VERIS Community Database (VCDB) Index column displays this number. This score evaluates the commonality of a threat that a given Safeguard prevents. 
Expectancy Score
CIS RAM v2.1 Companion Workbook also automatically calculates an Expectancy Score by comparing the commonality of reported threats to the maturity of the Safeguards that prevent the threats.
 
For more detailed information on how the CIS RAM Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook calculates the Expectancy Score, see Appendix C of the CIS-RAM for Implementation Group 2 (IG2) v2.1 PDF.
Impacts
Recall that in The Center for Internet Security's Risk Assessment Method module, Sean defined Mission Impact, Operational and Financial Objectives Impact, and Obligations Impact for each Asset Class (Enterprise, Devices, Applications, Data, Network, Users), as part of the process of estimating inherent risk criteria. The CIS RAM v21 Companion workbook automatically populates these magnitudes of harm.
Risk Score and Risk Level
Once Sean populates the Safeguard Maturity Score column of CIS RAM v2.1 Companion Workbook, the workbook automatically populates Risk Score and Risk Level.
The workbook calculates the Risk Score by multiplying the Expectancy Score by the highest Impact Score. The resulting Risk Level is either green, yellow, or red. These colors indicate whether the risk evaluated as “acceptable” as Sean described it in his Risk Acceptance Criteria in the previous module.
•	Green indicates that the risk evaluates as acceptable.
•	Yellow indicates that the risk is unacceptably high, but not urgent.
•	Red indicates that the risk is urgent.
Sean’s completed Risk Register now looks like this:
Asset Class	Applications	Applications	Applications
Asset Name	CarCore	CarCore	CarCore
CIS Safeguard #	2.1	2.2	2.3
CIS Safeguard Title	Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory	Ensure Authorized Software is Currently Supported 	Address Unauthorized Software 
Our Implementation	We use a software asset management tool that monitors for applications installed on all servers and end-user systems.	A software asset management tool validates that installed applications are currently supported and that the organization has implemented current versions.	AppXYZControl identifies installed applications that were not permitted and alerts the Operations (Ops) team. The Ops team removes unapproved applications within 5 business days.

See What the Customer Sees 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	List the benefits of Visual Remote Assistant.
•	Describe how a technician or agent uses Visual Remote Assistant.
Meet the Ursa Major Solar Team 
Ursa Major Solar is an innovative solar company in the American Southwest. It sells individual solar products and complete solar power systems. It uses Field Service to manage the field service team that installs and repairs solar systems. Let’s meet a few members of the team working to improve the field service journey for its customers.
•	CEO and cofounder Sita Nagappan-Alvarez. She makes key decisions about software purchases. She’s always on the lookout for ways to improve customer service while keeping her employees happy.
•	Salesforce admin Maria Jimenez. She’s the go-to person for setting up and maintaining Salesforce and Field Service. If you have a question about Salesforce, Maria has the answer.
•	Customer support agent Ada Balewa. She takes customer calls and solves their problems. Sometimes she refers customers to technicians, and sometimes she solves their problems herself.
•	Field Service technician James Clifton. He fixes customers’ solar products. James works with all Ursa Major Solar’s products, and he’s happy to bring sunshine to its customers.
Make Service Easier and Safer for Customers 
Sita keeps Ursa Major Solar at the forefront of the industry by making sure she knows what her customers want and what they don’t. These days, customers don’t want to have service technicians in their homes as often. While they’re happy with the service provided by technicians like Ada and James, they’d like to have Ursa Major help them perform simple jobs themselves.
Having agents or technicians investigate problems in customers’ homes without going inside seems like an unsolvable problem. Then Sita discovers Visual Remote Assistant. Visual Remote Assistant lets a contact center agent or remote technician see what the customer sees via video session. Now Ursa Major can provide the same exceptional service without being in the customer’s house using real-time visual support. A quick wave of a customer’s mobile device shows the agent or technician which product is installed, the settings it’s currently using, and more.
Visual Remote Assistant ties into Ursa Major’s existing Field Service product, so remote technicians can easily see customer information. Details like product type, installation date, and previous visits to the customer’s home are easy to access. Technicians don’t waste time asking questions they’ve asked before and save time for the customer and Ursa Major. Even better, customer problems are often resolved in the first call, without the customer having to schedule a service call and wait for a technician.
What they see varies depending on how it’s set up in their org, but here’s what an Ursa Major agent or technician sees during a call.
 
•	Call (1)—What the customer sees during the Visual Remote Assistant session.
•	Customer information (2)—The agent or technician’s page shows customer contact information, the installed assets, past work orders for this customer, and more.
•	Visual Remote Assistant pane (3)—Where an agent or technician starts Visual Remote Assistant, allowing them to see what the customer sees and guide them to resolve their issue.
Visual Remote Assistant in Action 
Let’s say that Ada Balewa is on the phone with a customer named Violet Winkle. Violet is having trouble with a leaky solar hot water heater. Ursa Major has been called out before about this leaky hot water heater, so Ada quickly reads the notes in the work order on that visit. Ada suspects a loose pipe fitting, but she has to see the hot water heater to be sure.
She suggests that they transition to a video call so she can see what’s going on with Violet’s hot water heater. Violet agrees and Ada uses Visual Remote Assistant to send a text to Violet. Violet taps the link and it sends her to a web page in her mobile browser. She approves the terms and conditions and allows Visual Remote Assistant to access her phone’s camera for the duration of the call. Now Ada can see everything that Violet sees.
Ada asks Violet to point her phone at the leak and follow it back. She quickly spots the problem. It’s a leaking pipe fitting, just like she thought. When she tries to explain its location, Violet doesn’t understand, so Ada draws a big red arrow on her screen. Because Visual Remote Assistant uses augmented reality, the arrow shows up on Violet’s phone screen too. Now they can both see where the problem is.
Ada tells Violet to turn the fitting to the right to tighten it. After Violet does, she wipes off the pipe with a towel and checks that it’s no longer leaking. Problem solved! Violet takes a picture of the fixed pipe and it’s added to her user record so the next time she calls, Ursa Major will have that history.
Visual Remote Assistant allows Ursa Major to resolve issues the first time around. If more help is needed, agents or technicians can add a subject matter expert to the session.
If they can’t solve the problem right away, the agent or technician can figure out the next steps. Next steps include things like ordering parts, walking the customer through installing the new parts, or scheduling an onsite service call.
Let’s watch a company resolving a customer problem using Visual Remote Assistant.
Sita understands the value that Visual Remote Assistant can bring to Ursa Major Solar. She’s happy to see that it allows Ursa Major a way to deliver exceptional service from anywhere. Then the team can give the customer real-time visual feedback to diagnose and even fix problems without going onsite. She’s excited to use Visual Remote Assistant at Ursa Major.

Set Up Visual Remote Assistant 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	List the prerequisites for using Visual Remote Assistant.
•	Install the Visual Remote Assistant managed package.
•	Train agents and field service technicians to work with customers using Visual Remote Assistant.
Are You Ready? 
 Ursa Major’s admin, Maria, makes sure that she has everything set up to use Visual Remote Assistant. She runs through the list of prerequisites.
•	Service Cloud or Field Service licenses. Ursa Major uses Field Service, so it’s already enabled, customized, and the permissions are set up.
•	Lightning Experience. Ursa Major uses Lightning Experience, too, so that’s ready.
•	Licenses for Visual Remote Assistant. Sita worked with her Salesforce Account Executive to purchase the necessary licenses.
•	The correct permission sets.
Maria has everything she needs. She’s ready to get started.
Install the Managed Package 
Maria is ready to install the Visual Remote Assistant managed package. For a business org, you may want to install new packages in a sandbox org first to test them but here we install directly into your Trailhead playground.
 
 We assume you're a Visual Remote Assistant administrator with the proper permissions and licenses to install and use the managed package. If that's not the case, that’s OK. Read along to learn how your administrator would take the steps in a production org. Don't try to follow these steps in your Trailhead Playground. Visual Remote Assistant isn't available in the Trailhead Playground.
1.	Open an incognito browser window in Chrome.
2.	In the incognito window, paste this link http://sfdc.co/visualremoteassistant-install into the address bar.
3.	On the Salesforce login screen, enter the username and password for your org, then click Log In.
4.	Enter the verification code from your email.
5.	Select Install for Admins Only, select the acknowledgment, then click Install.
6.	Approve the request to grant access to third-party websites.
7.	Wait for a message telling you that you’ll be notified by email when the package is installed, and click Done.
8.	Check your email for notification that the package installed.
It can take a few minutes, but when the installation is complete, check out what you’ve installed. In the App Launcher, search for visual.
 
Maria selects Visual Remote Assistant to see more.
Train Employees 
Ada and James work together to develop a training program for agents and technicians. Ada is responsible for the agent perspective and James focuses on how technicians use Visual Remote Assistant.
They create a list of common scenarios that can benefit from a visual connection to the customer. The list includes basic in-home repairs. Here’s part of Ursa Major’s list of tasks that customers can perform. It’s not a full list, but it gives you a sense of Ursa Major’s goals.
•	Examine hot water heaters leaking inside the house for loose connections or defective parts.
•	If solar panels on the ground are losing efficiency, visually inspect them for loose debris.
•	Check to make sure that all connections are securely fastened.
•	Use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert barcodes, QR codes, and more into text to look up panel warranty, item number, and more.
Then they create a list of common scenarios where a visit must be scheduled. For example, some tasks are too dangerous for a customer to attempt. Instead, a knowledgeable technician must come onsite to fix the problem. Ursa Major never compromises on customer safety.
•	Don’t attempt to fix problems with electrical components that could shock or injure the customer.
•	Don’t have customers climb onto their roof or go to any area that’s dangerous to access.
•	Don’t disassemble complex components that require a delicate touch or specialized expertise.
Finally, they list the tasks that agents and technicians must perform to use Visual Remote Assistant.
•	Decide if it’s a case for Visual Remote Assistant.
•	Locate and start Visual Remote Assistant.
•	Walk customers through connecting their mobile device.
•	Take pictures to include in the record or forward to a subject matter expert.
•	Use augmented reality to add information to a customer’s phone display, like arrows or circles.
•	Know when to add a subject matter expert to the agent’s ongoing session.

Learn the Foundations of Carbon Accounting 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:   
•	Explain the basic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) accounting principles. 
•	Describe the different objects that work to create a carbon accounting framework. 
Before We Start
If you completed the Net Zero Cloud Basics module, then you already know how Northern Trail Outfitters uses Net Zero Cloud to support and scope their climate strategy. Not to mention Net Zero Cloud Admin Essentials module which outlined how an admin can set up and configure the application. If you haven’t completed these modules, we recommend taking them to have more context as you dive into carbon accounting. 
Account for Your Actions
The world is in a climate crisis and the need to reduce carbon emissions has never been more urgent. Regulators, investors, and customers are urging companies to get to net zero faster. Companies are faced with the challenge of tracking the complete spectrum of their value chain emissions, which can be a complex and cumbersome process. In this module, we’ll look at how Net Zero Cloud can help you meet that challenge.  
Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO) is using Salesforce’s Net Zero Cloud to collect, analyze, and report energy usage data and track their carbon footprint. As a part of its net zero commitment, NTO plans to track its carbon footprint and set long-term goals to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
How Net Zero Cloud Can Help
Today, companies are generally expected to gather data on their emissions-producing activities, calculate, and report their contribution to atmospheric emissions, and reduce emissions across all three scopes. Check out this help topic to see examples of how emissions are qualified as scope 1, 2, and 3. Net Zero Cloud makes this entire carbon accounting process easy and streamlined for a company like NTO. Net Zero Cloud provides the tools to quantify and measure carbon emissions, and helps companies make informed decisions about which mitigation strategies will be most effective. 
In Net Zero Cloud, all emissions are converted to their carbon dioxide equivalents and are reported in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). Wondering what tCO₂e means? tCO₂e is a standardized unit for counting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, regardless of whether they're from carbon dioxide or another gas, such as methane, nitrous oxide, or one of the dozens of refrigerants used throughout the world today. 
Net Zero Cloud helps companies create an annual emissions inventory. A GHG inventory is the basis for efforts to reduce emissions and their associated environmental impacts. Once you know what your emissions are, it’s easier to tackle the process of reducing the impact of these emissions. An accurate GHG inventory also helps companies forecast emissions in future years. 
Calculating GHG emissions also enables companies like NTO to set science-based emissions reduction targets. An accurate GHG inventory is the required starting point for determining which targets should be set and for determining how to quantify these targets. 
Let’s follow along as Sam Rajan, the Chief Sustainability Officer at NTO, explores carbon accounting using Net Zero Cloud for all stationary and vehicle asset sources. 
 
Explore the Building Blocks of Carbon Accounting
There are four key building blocks in Net Zero Cloud that help users manage the carbon accounting process. 
•	Emissions Sources: Emissions sources represent the assets of an enterprise that generate carbon emissions. The three types of emissions sources in Net Zero Cloud are:
•	Stationary Asset Environmental Sources: Assets that are stationary in nature, such as office buildings, data centers, or warehouses.
•	Vehicle Asset Emissions Sources: Assets that are mobile in nature, such as company vehicles or private jets.
•	Scope 3 Emissions Sources: Scope 3 activities that are the source of emissions, such as transportation, purchase of raw materials, hotel stays, and so on. This category of emissions results from the activities of the company that are from sources not owned or controlled by the company.
•	Energy Use Records: Energy use records are created for a specific date or date range and are associated with an emissions source. Examples include monthly electricity consumption for a stationary asset or a single commercial flight record. Users can enter energy consumption information, such as the quantity of electricity, diesel, or natural gas consumed, over a specific period of time in various units of measure that are specific to the activity or fuel being consumed. Based on the emissions factors referenced by the energy use record, Net Zero Cloud does the work for you by converting the entered consumption into carbon emissions.
•	Emissions Factors: Emissions factors are used to convert energy consumption into GHG emissions. Several emissions factors in the form of reference datasets from standard government or private sources are preconfigured in Net Zero Cloud. Examples include the eGRID dataset for electricity subgrid emissions in the United States and the EEIO datasets that estimate tCO2e per monetary output across most of the 8 upstream scope 3 categories. Emissions factors specific to a region, business sector, or country can also be added to Net Zero Cloud.
•	Carbon Footprints: A carbon footprint is an estimate of the amount of CO2e released to the environment during the lifecycle of a product or an activity. Carbon footprints primarily exist to summarize values from multiple energy use records. There are three types of carbon footprints in Net Zero Cloud, corresponding to the three types of emissions sources.
•	Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions by scope, summarized from underlying energy uses for a stationary asset across all fuel types. Net Zero Cloud automatically creates Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Item records to show summarized emissions information for a single fuel type.
•	Vehicle Asset Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions by scope, summarized from underlying energy uses for a vehicular asset.
•	Scope 3 Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions from underlying energy uses for a scope 3 activity. While you can associate a Scope 3 Emissions Source to the carbon footprint record, you can also associate a stationary source. For example, a warehouse can be the epicenter of scope 3 activities such as purchase of goods and services, transportation and distribution, and waste generation. You can associate the required energy use records and procurement summary records to determine from which activities you want to calculate emissions. 
Now that Sam understands the building blocks for carbon accounting, he maps out the connections between these objects. 
Emissions Source Type 	Energy Use Type 	Applicable Emissions Factors 	Carbon Footprint Type 
Stationary Asset Environmental Source 	Stationary Asset Energy Use 	Other Emissions Factor 
Electricity Emissions Factor 
Refrigerant Emissions Factor 	Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint 	Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Item (for Electricity)

To understand the relationship between emissions sources, energy uses, and carbon footprints for scope 3 activities, check out Carbon Accounting for Scope 3 with Net Zero Cloud. 
In the next unit, we focus on stationary asset sources and stationary asset energy uses.

Track Emissions for Stationary Assets 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	List the key fields on a stationary asset environmental source record. 
•	Explain how to specify values for key fields on stationary asset energy use records. 
•	Show a simple calculation of emissions on a stationary asset energy use record. 
Take Stock of Your Buildings
Stationary asset environmental sources are used to represent all buildings and data centers associated with a company. Let’s look at how Sam handles this for NTO. Since all of NTO’s stationary asset records come with a few key fields, Sam creates a record for the NTO Headquarters and reviews and populates the key fields. 
 
Let’s take a deeper dive into these fields and what they represent. 
Field 	Description 	Impact on Calculations 
Carbon Emissions Scope Allocation 	The object that specifies the GHG Protocol scope of emissions for different fuels. Each fuel type has its own scope allocation record in the Carbon Emissions Scope Allocation Values object. 	This field helps the user specify the scope to which the emissions from each fuel is allocated. 
Refrigerant Emissions Factor 	The object that holds the global warming potential (GWP) for cooling refrigerants, such as CFCs, HFCs, and HCFCs used in stationary asset sources. You can create one record per refrigerant type. 	To properly calculate tCO₂e from refrigerant leakage, the refrigerant’s GWP is multiplied by the quantity of refrigerant leakage. 
Electricity Emissions Factor Set 	The object that holds a range of information that's relevant to calculating the scope 2 emissions generated from electricity. The GHG Protocol provides two methods for tracking scope 2 emissions: the market-based method and the location-based method. There are fields specific to both of these methods in the electricity emissions factor set. 	Yearly datasets from sources such as Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) website can be uploaded to accurately calculate electricity-based emissions in a specific postal code. 
Other Emissions Factor Set 	The object that holds predefined emissions and conversion factors for emissions resulting from use of natural gas, propane, and on-site diesel use. While in the other emissions factor record, you can define the global warming potential values for CH₄ and N₂O, in the associated other emissions factor set item records, you can specify values for different fuel types, such as gasoline, LPG, or biodiesel. 	All individual emissions and conversion factors for sources that are not included in the electricity grid or scope 3 data types are captured as part of the Other Emissions Factors. 
Regional Building Energy Intensity 	Lookup to a building energy intensity record from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data. The CBECS is a national sample survey that collects energy usage information on commercial buildings across the USA. The energy usage data serves as a reliable and publicly available standard, and is preloaded in Net Zero Cloud. The value is automatically populated when the country is the United States, the postal code is valid, and the total floor area is populated in the record. 	NTO can use the CBECS building energy intensity data to plug energy use gaps in the data of commercial buildings (more on this later). 
Energy Use for Stationary Assets
Buildings and warehouses at NTO use electricity, diesel for backup generators, and refrigerants for cooling. Each of these require separate energy use records associated with the same stationary asset source.  
Within energy use records, Net Zero Cloud automatically calculates many of the fields based on energy use data and emissions factors. 
 
Data for Key Fields
Sam works to create the energy use records to allow for emissions calculations. He looks at the information within an energy use record, one section at a time. 
General Information 
On a stationary asset’s energy use record, information like the total and occupied floor area and whether the asset is company-owned helps with calculations. Sam can also specify the stationary asset for which energy consumption is being recorded, the start and end dates of the energy consumption, and the corresponding stationary asset carbon footprint record. 
 
Consumption 
Depending on the type of fuel for which an energy use record is created, this section helps Sam define the following. 
•	Fuel type: There are multiple fuel types for which you can enter energy consumption, including Electricity, Diesel, Natural Gas, and Propane. 
•	Fuel consumption unit: Multiple units of measure are supported natively in Net Zero Cloud corresponding to the different fuel types that are supported. 
 
Emissions Factors  
If the emissions factors are specified on the stationary asset environmental source, they are automatically inherited by the associated energy use records. Thanks to the flexibility of Net Zero Cloud, Sam can also override the values on each energy use record if he needs to. 
 
Supplemental Emissions 
Sam can also specify supplemental emissions for each scope to manually adjust emissions, if needed. These are used in the calculated total emissions. 
 
Grid Mix 
The grid mix values on the energy use record are calculated based on the grid mix percentages specified in the associated electricity emissions factor set record. If he needs to, Sam can override the values for location-based and market-based grid mix on an electricity emissions factor set record based on the information he gets from the suppliers for NTO’s buildings in a specific postal code. 
•	The market-based grid mix depends on the electricity that organizations have chosen to purchase from specific suppliers and takes supplier-specific emissions rates into consideration. 
•	The location-based grid mix depends on the emissions intensity of the local grid area where the electricity usage occurs. 
 
Renewable Energy 
Renewable energy displays the quantity of electricity that’s generated from renewable sources. Sam can specifically allocate electricity generated from renewable sources in the Renewable Energy Type and Allocated Renewable Energy fields. The basis for the renewable energy calculations is the allocated renewable energy value entered on the energy use record and the market-based grid mix percentage on the electricity emissions factors record. 
 
Emissions 
This section displays the autocalculated emissions in tCO₂e by scope corresponding to the entered energy consumption in the stationary asset energy use record. 
 
A Few Calculations Explained
Now that Sam has explored the key information on an energy use record for a stationary asset, he tries to understand how the emissions are calculated. Sam creates the following energy use records for the NTO Office Headquarters Miami stationary asset environmental source record. 
Stationary Asset Environmental Source 	Stationary Asset Energy Use 	Fuel Type 	Fuel Consumption Details 
NTO Headquarters Miami 	Monthly Electricity Bill Jan 	Electricity 	1000 kWh 
	NTO Headquarters Miami 	Monthly Fuel Bill Jan 	Diesel 	1000 Liters 
	NTO Headquarters Miami 	Q1 Refrigerant Bill 	Refrigerant 	10 kg 
Calculation of Electricity Related Emissions 
The United States - US-TX - electricityMap 2019 emissions factor record specifies the following. 
•	CO₂e Emissions Rate for Location Based Emissions Factors = 396.78 g/kWh 
•	Location-Based Coal-Mix Percentage: 20% 
•	Location-Based Gas-Mix Percentage: 47% 
•	Location-Based Nuclear-Mix Percentage: 11% 
 
Let’s see how the energy values are calculated on the stationary asset energy use record Monthly Electricity Bill Jan. 
Scope 2 Location-Based Emissions (tCO₂e) = Electricity consumption (in kWh) * Emissions factor (g/kWh) / 10^6 (tCO₂e conversion factor)  
                                                                       = 1000*396.78/1000000 = 0.3968 tCO₂e 
Furthermore, here’s how the information is calculated for the Location-Based Grid Mix. 
•	Location-Based Electricity from Coal (kWh): 20% of 1000 kWh = 200 kWh 
•	Location-Based Electricity from Gas (kWh): 47% of 1000 kWh = 470 kWh 
•	Location-Based Electricity from Nuclear (kWh): 11% of 1000 kWh = 110 kWh 
 
A similar approach is followed to calculate market-based electricity emissions by referring to the market-based grid mix percentages. 
Calculation of Diesel Related Emissions 
The Fuel Conversion Factors - DEFRA EPA 2018 factor set record specifies the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. 
•	GWP of CH₄: 28 
•	GWP of N₂O: 265 
The OEFSI-0000006 factor set item record specifies the following. 
Fuel Type 	Calorific Value 	Supplied tCO₂e Emissions Factor 	CH₄ Emissions Factor 	CO₂ Emissions Factor 	N₂O Emissions Factor 
Diesel 	15 kWh/L 	12.45 tonnes/mWh 	3.00 	73.96 	0.06 
The consumption of diesel (1000 Liters) is first converted to its kWh equivalent using its calorific value, which is 15 kWh/L.  
Total Fuel Consumption = 15000 kWh (1000*15) 
Next, this value is multiplied by the Supplied tCO₂e emissions factor and divided by the conversion factor. 
Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = Supplied tCO₂e Emissions Factor * Total Fuel Consumption/1000  
                                               = (12.45*15000/1000) = 186.75 
 
Calculation of Refrigerant Related Emissions 
Lastly, let’s check out how emissions are calculated when the fuel type is Refrigerant. The Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) - IPCC AR4 2007 refrigerant emissions factor record specifies the Global Warming Potential as 22,800. 
Here’s how the emissions calculation shapes up. 
Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = GWP * Fuel Consumption(kg)/1000  
                                             = 22,800*10/1000 = 228 
 
In the next unit, Sam creates a carbon footprint for this stationary asset and learns more about the calculations. Let’s follow along with him.

Manage Carbon Footprint Records for Stationary Assets 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	List the key fields on stationary asset carbon footprint records. 
•	Explain how scope allocation is determined for various fuel sources. 
•	Describe how emissions are calculated for a data center. 
Introduction to Carbon Footprints
Sam is making great progress! He defined emissions sources and energy uses for stationary assets and looked at how emissions are calculated in the Net Zero Cloud app. Now he concentrates on rolling up the emissions data to a carbon footprint record. Sam can attach multiple stationary asset energy use records to a stationary asset carbon footprint record to get a single calculated carbon footprint for an asset. 
While a stationary asset carbon footprint shows the tCO₂e emissions for an asset, its child records, Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Items, show the tCO₂e emissions for individual fuel types. So, if Sam creates a carbon footprint record to calculate the total tCO₂e emissions for the NTO Headquarters for 2021, he can also have carbon footprint items that show emissions separately from, say, electricity, natural gas, and diesel. 
Note that while Sam can manually create carbon footprint records and associate them with energy use records, the application can also do this for him. If a carbon footprint record exists for a given period, all new energy use records falling within that period get automatically associated with this carbon footprint record. If Sam creates a new energy use record and it covers a time period for which a carbon footprint record does not yet exist, Net Zero Cloud automatically creates a new carbon footprint and associates the energy record with it. This saves Sam a lot of time. 
 
Only the energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are automatically rolled up into the carbon footprint record that he creates. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to get View All or Modify All permission for the required records. 
When Sam attaches energy use records to a carbon footprint record, the scope 1, 2, and 3 calculations of the energy use records automatically sum to a total value shown in the carbon footprint record. Just like for individual energy use records, Sam can also manually specify supplemental emissions by scope on all carbon footprint record types. 
Stationary Asset Carbon Footprints
The following key data points are available on a stationary asset carbon footprint record. 
General Information 
Sam can specify the Stationary Asset Environment Source to which this footprint is associated, the reporting period of the carbon footprint, the stage of the footprint in the overall lifecycle, the previous year’s annual carbon footprint record, and the audit approval status. Sam can also select the allocation status for renewable energy used in the asset source. 
Building Details 
Sam can specify the building energy intensity lookup and the regional building energy intensity lookup that can be used to resolve gaps in the energy consumption data for a commercial building stationary asset (more on this in the next unit).  
If the Stationary Asset Environmental Source record for this footprint is already associated with a Regional Building Energy Intensity record, then the same Regional Building Energy Intensity record is automatically populated in the Carbon Footprint record. However, Sam needs to identify the Building Energy Intensity record that is most applicable to the building’s carbon footprint and select that record.  
 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Sam can see the autocalculated values for Total Scope 1, Total Scope 2 Market-Based, Total Scope 2 Location-Based, Total Scope 3 Upstream, and Total Scope 3 Downstream Emissions (tCO₂e) for the associated source. The values are derived by summing up values from the underlying energy use records. 
 
Total Energy Use Summaries 
Total Energy Consumption for the stationary asset source is calculated in kilowatt-hours, megawatt-hours, and gigajoules. Sam can also see the Total Building Indirect Energy Consumption (MWh), which is the consumption of energy specifically from electricity, heat, cooling, and steam, and excludes emissions from other fuels. 
 
Renewable Energy Details 
Based on the allocation status of the carbon footprint, Sam can see the Total Renewable Energy generated, both in absolute kWh and as a percentage of the overall electricity consumed. Also, he can see allocated renewable energy expressed in kWh, which is the renewable energy explicitly defined in energy use records. Sam can refer to these values to check the proportion of renewable or “cleaner” sources of energy used for each asset. This positions him better to meet his goal of increasing the allocated renewable energy percentage.  
 
Grid Mix Information 
Sam can see the rolled up values from all electricity energy use records for both location-based and market-based grid mix data for the asset source. And just like for energy use records, the data is categorized by fuel sources, such as biomass, coal, solar, wind, and oil. This makes it easy for Sam to see the big picture but also hone in on the fuel source components and how they each play a role. 
 
Energy Use Intensity Comparisons 
Sam can see the total regional electricity consumption intensity and the percentage difference between the regional intensity and the intensity of the associated carbon footprint item for electricity consumption. Sam can use this information to understand how far off a particular stationary asset is from the average electricity consumption in that region. If the variance is too high, maybe it’s time to make the building more energy-efficient. 
 
Data Quality Metrics 
Sam can view the average monthly electricity consumption and the energy consumption intensities for the current and previous years, calculated both in square meters and square feet. Another handy value is to check the maximum variance above and below the average expressed as a percentage. This is super useful for Sam to understand the role seasonality plays and to identify any data abnormalities. 
 
Footprint Items
The Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Items for a Carbon Footprint contain data for an individual fuel type. Let’s take the example from the previous unit to see a snapshot of how data rolls up in Net Zero Cloud. 
 
Here’s a way to see how carbon footprint items roll up data based on fuel type, and how carbon footprints roll up data based on consolidated energy consumption across all fuel types. 
Stationary Asset Environmental Source 	Stationary Asset Energy Use 	Fuel Type 	Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Item 	Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint 
NTO Office Headquarters Miami 	Record A 	Electricity 	CFI for Electricity 	CF for Miami Headquarters 
	NTO Office Headquarters Miami 	Record B 	Diesel 		CFI for Diesel 	CF for Miami Headquarters 
	NTO Office Headquarters Miami 	Record C 	Refrigerant 		CFI for Refrigerant 	CF for Miami Headquarters 
The following key information can be found on a stationary asset carbon footprint item record. 
•	Total Emissions (tCO₂e) from the fuel type. 
•	Total Energy Consumption of the Fuel Type, expressed in kWh equivalent, even if the underlying fuel is not electricity. 
•	Energy Consumption Intensity of the Fuel Type for the current and previous years. 
 
What’s the Scope?
For each energy consumption record entered, there is a default scope against which the emissions are recorded based on the fuel type and asset ownership. The asset ownership is determined by the Company-Owned Asset checkbox on an asset’s record. The associated energy use records inherit this status from the asset, but it can also be overridden. 
To understand the default scope allocation performed by Net Zero Cloud for various fuel types and for assets owned and leased by the reporting company, check out Stationary Asset Energy Use.  
There are typical allocations based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance, but exceptions occur frequently in the world of carbon accounting. There can be instances where Sam needs to change the default scope allocation for a specific asset source. For example, NTO might own the building, and therefore consider most fuels to be scope 1, while leasing equipment and considering emissions from that equipment to be scope 3. These determinations are often made with the help of experienced consultants. 
The default scope allocations in Net Zero Cloud can be overridden through the Scope Allocation capability, where Sam can assign the scope into which a particular fuel type’s emissions must be aggregated. To do this, he creates a new carbon emissions scope allocation record, manually sets each individual fuel’s allocation to a scope in the child records, and then assigns the new carbon emissions scope allocation record to his asset. By using Scope Allocation, Net Zero Cloud users have ultimate flexibility in how they account for their GHG emissions. 
 
Data Centers as Asset Sources
NTO, being a retail company, doesn’t operate any data centers. But there are companies who do, and they must define their data centers as stationary asset environmental sources. The reason that data centers are considered a special case in Net Zero Cloud is because of the way total electricity usage in the facility is estimated from known electricity consumption of the IT equipment.  
A Salesforce admin can configure the record type for the asset and information can be captured for data centers, similar to commercial buildings. While most calculations are similar for emissions, there are two major differences. 
•	If the fuel type on a stationary asset energy use record is Electricity for a data center asset source, the user must specify a value for the field Power Usage Effectiveness. Generally a value between 1 and 2, this is the ratio of the total amount of energy used by a data center to the energy delivered to just the computing equipment. The calculated emissions are scaled up by this value to calculate tCO₂e for electricity. For other fuel types, there are no changes to calculated emissions.
 
Therefore, for data center assets, Total Fuel Consumption (kWh) = Fuel Consumption (kWh) * Power Usage Effectiveness
•	In the other emissions factor set, there’s a provision to show the Data Center Refrigerant Leakage Rate value expressed in kg/IT kWh, which specifies the leakage rate of the refrigerant used for cooling the data center's computing equipment.
 
On a stationary asset carbon footprint record, the following values are autocalculated when the associated asset is a Data Center. 
•	Average Data Center Power Usage Effectiveness 
•	Data Center IT Diesel Consumption Intensity 
•	Previous Year Data Center Power Usage Effectiveness 
 
Sam has explored carbon accounting for stationary assets and learned about the calculations. In the next unit, let’s follow along as Sam uses Net Zero Cloud to fill gaps in the carbon footprint data.

Benchmark Building Energy Intensity and Fill Gaps in the Carbon Footprint Data 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	List the possible data gaps in a carbon footprint record. 
•	Explain building benchmarks. 
•	List the steps to fill gaps in a carbon footprint record. 
No Data, No Worries!
NTO has many buildings across the globe. The company uses several energy sources to heat and cool the buildings, and power gadgets and devices. As we saw in the earlier unit, Net Zero Cloud uses energy use records to calculate the carbon footprint. Sam uses the monthly utility bills to obtain the energy consumption data for these assets, which he then feeds into Net Zero Cloud as energy use records.  
But there’s a problem. Electricity bills for a couple of months for a few of NTO’s buildings aren’t available. And there’s no way for Sam to know the total energy usage for these months.  
Any gaps in the energy use data can cause inaccurate carbon footprint accounting, which can lead to incorrect annual emissions inventories. We can’t stress enough the need for reliable and auditable carbon inventories for accurate sustainability impact reporting.  
Here’s a list of situations that can cause gaps in the energy use data.  
•	Missing energy consumption data: The monthly energy consumption bills are missing or the data is unavailable for some reason. 
•	Orphan energy use records: Energy use records that share the reporting year and organization asset with a carbon footprint (CF) record but aren’t linked to the CF record yet. 
•	Date issues: Two or more energy use records cover the same reporting period but have issues with dates. For example, missing start or end dates, start or end dates being out of range over the same reporting period, or overlapping start and end dates. 
So what should Sam do? Fortunately, Net Zero Cloud provides a quick and easy way to intelligently identify gaps in the carbon footprint data and fill them. Sam can use industry benchmarks or create custom benchmarks. 
 
Data gap filling is available only for stationary assets with the Commercial Building record type. As part of the initial configuration for stationary assets, the Salesforce admin creates the Commercial Building record type. (To learn more about the admin setup, see the Net Zero Cloud Admin Essentials Trailhead module.) 
Benchmark Your Building Energy Usage
Net Zero Cloud supports the use of the following benchmarking approaches to fill in the missing energy use data.

The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) is a national sample survey that researches and collects energy-related building characteristics and energy usage data of U.S. commercial buildings. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes CBECS results. 
For reference data, the Salesforce admin loads the CBECS industry benchmark data into Regional Building Energy Intensity data records. 
Create and Use Your Own Benchmark 
Sam can use BEI Builder in Net Zero Cloud to compute a benchmark and develop insights into the average energy usage across all NTO buildings. Sam can then use the benchmark for filling in the gaps for buildings with missing energy use data. These numbers are stored in Building Energy Intensity (BEI) data records. BEI is measured in kWh/sqft or kWh/m² per year. 
Create a Building Energy Intensity Record Using BEI Builder
BEI Builder guides Sam through the process of creating BEI records for NTO’s commercial buildings. It calculates the benchmark by averaging energy consumption values from existing energy use records.  

 
Only energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are automatically pulled into the BEI record that Sam creates. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to get View All or Modify All permission for all the required records. 
Energy use records that meet certain filter criteria are considered for BEI calculation. Let’s go over these criteria. 
Averaging Window Start Date and Averaging Window End Date 
Energy use records must belong to the period defined by these dates.  
Building Size Category  
Energy use records must be for assets whose total floor area falls in the range defined by the building size category record. For more information, see Create a Building Size Category record. 

 
BEI Builder uses the occupied floor area of buildings to calculate the BEI to ensure that usage is estimated for the occupied space in which the energy was consumed.  
The floor area values are retrieved from the corresponding stationary asset environmental source record for the asset. 

Building Asset Type 
The buildings must be of the asset type defined by Building Asset Type. Asset types can be Office, Restaurant, or Hotel. 
 
Ensure that the record type for the asset is mapped with the stationary asset type - Commercial Building. 
GeographicalArea 
The buildings must be from the business region or country defined by Geographical Area. 
Energy consumption of buildings can vary depending on the climate and other external factors that are specific to a geographical area. Hence, geographical area information plays a key role in creating a distinct benchmark that’s used for data gap filling. 
If Sam wants to include energy use records that are created during the data gap filling process, he can select the System Generated Energy Use Records Included checkbox. 
On clicking Create, the Calculate Building Energy Intensity data processing job runs in the backend to calculate BEI and create a record. The Salesforce admin has already activated this data processing engine job template. For more information about BEI calculations, see Building Energy Intensity Calculations. 
Using CBECS vs BEI
Whether you use the industry benchmark (CBECS) data or your own benchmark for filling data gaps depends on your organization’s requirements and preferences. For example, organizations can choose CBECS for buildings in the USA as it’s reliable and has been validated by government agencies. If CBECS data isn’t available for a certain fuel type or region, or the organization wants to use its own benchmark, you’d go with BEI. 
Let’s follow along as Sam uses Net Zero Cloud to identify and fill data gaps in one of the CF records. 
Fill Data Gaps in Carbon Accounting with Net Zero Cloud
To get started, Sam selects Fill Data Gaps from the action menu of a carbon footprint record, which launches a wizard. Data gap filling in Net Zero Cloud is a three-step process. 

Step 1. Associate the orphan energy use records with the carbon footprint record. 
The first page lists energy use records that match the reporting year and organization asset of the CF record but aren’t yet associated with this or any other CF record.  

Sam reviews the list, selects the ones that must be associated with the CF record, and clicks Save. The selected records get associated with the CF record and are removed from the list. 
 
Only the energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are displayed in the list. 
Sam clicks Next to move to the next step.  
Step 2. Fix energy use report dates. 
The next page lists energy use records that are associated with the CF record but have issues with dates.  

By default, the list shows all such records but Sam can choose to view records with specific issues only. For example, to view records with missing dates, Sam keeps only the Missing dates checkbox selected and clicks Search to refresh the list.  
Sam fixes the dates and clicks Save, and then clicks Next to move to the final step. 
Step 3. For fuel types with missing energy use data, create and associate energy use records. 
Steps 1 and 2 helped Sam identify and associate unassociated energy use records with the CF record, and correct date issues in associated energy use records. The final step is to fill the data gaps. 
Sam must select the fuel type for which he wants to fill the data gaps, and the fill method. He selects Cooling for the fuel type and Regional Building Energy Intensity for the fill method. The page shows record entries for the period with missing data and suggested values in the Fill Data (kWh) column.  

In the case of Regional Building Energy Intensity fill method, Net Zero Cloud uses the intensity value from the preloaded CBECS data. 
This fill method is available only if a Regional BEI record is associated with the CF record (Regional Building Energy Intensity field).
Record entries on the page provide details of the energy use records that will be automatically created. Sam selects the desired entries per fuel type and saves the changes before clicking Finish.  
The corresponding energy use records are created. Sam notices that the System Generated Record checkbox in the Data Gap Filling Audit Information section of each of these records is selected.  

Likewise, Sam reviews, identifies, and fixes data gaps and inconsistencies in other CF records.  
Let’s see how Net Zero Cloud calculates the suggested values when we select other fill methods.  
Building Energy Intensity: Net Zero Cloud uses the intensity value that Sam created using BEI Builder. 
This method is available only if a BEI record is associated with the CF record (Building Energy Intensity field). 
Previous Year Daily Average: Net Zero Cloud computes and uses the average daily energy consumption data from the previous year. This method is available only if the previous year’s CF record is associated with the Previous Year Annual Carbon Footprint field in the CF record, and if at least one energy use record for the selected fuel type exists.  

Current Year Daily Average: Net Zero Cloud computes and uses the average daily energy consumption data from the current year. This method is available only if at least one energy use record for the selected fuel type exists. 
Manual: Sam must enter the energy use data for filling the gap manually.  

Sam is now ready to see how carbon accounting works for vehicle assets. Let’s find out in the next unit.

Track Carbon Emissions for Vehicle Asset Sources 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	List the key fields on vehicle asset records. 
•	List the key fields on vehicle asset energy use records. 
•	Explain how to calculate emissions from vehicle assets. 
NTO’s Vehicle Assets
NTO has two key vehicle emissions sources to account for: the private jets that NTO operates and the shuttle cars that are used for employee commuting. Sam creates a company-owned asset for a private jet used by the CEO of the company, and a record for the company shuttle in the Miami region, which they lease from a local car rental company for employee commutes.  
While most fields remain similar for the vehicle emissions sources, Sam takes a look at the key fields that impact emissions calculations. 
•	Vehicle type: Based on the record types configured by the admin, you can select the type of vehicle for which you want to calculate emissions. NTO can select between Fleet Vehicles and Private Jets.
•	Other emissions factors: Lookup to the object that holds reference data for emissions from various fuel sources. Other emissions factor item records associated with the parent other emissions factor set record contains emissions factors for different fuel types, such as jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, or CNG. 
Apart from these key fields, Sam can also add additional information, such as the scope allocation, lease ID, lease expiration date, vehicle ID, and business region on a vehicle asset emissions source record. 
 
Energy Use Records for Vehicle Assets
Let’s turn our attention to energy use. Now that he’s recorded his vehicle assets, Sam can specify supplier-provided fuel consumption data. Here are the details that Sam can specify on the energy use record. 
•	Fuel consumption details: Depending on the type of asset, fuel type can either be jet fuel for private jets, or any other fuel for fleet vehicles, such as biodiesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), diesel, or gasoline. Sam can also specify fuel consumption values in liters or gallons from gas station bills and fuel refill receipts.
•	Distance: This is the distance traveled by a company car or the private jet for the reporting period. Distance can be specified in kilometers or miles.
•	Aircraft details: Sam can specify the type of aircraft, which impacts the fuel efficiency and consumption patterns. From the flight receipts, Sam can also specify the flight duration and flight date. 
The following attributes are auto calculated based on the values provided and the data that is in an emissions factor record linked to. 
•	Fuel Efficiency 
•	CH₄, CO₂, and N₂O Emissions (kg) 
•	Scope-Based Emissions (tCO₂e) 
•	Total Fuel Consumption in US Gallons and Liters 
•	Aircraft Fuel Economy (Gallons per Hour) 
 
Vehicle Asset Carbon Footprint
Now it’s time for Sam to create a carbon footprint record for each vehicle asset that he’d specified earlier to calculate the total carbon emissions from a vehicle represented in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). The conversion factors from the associated Other Emissions Factors and related Other Emissions Factor Items are used to calculate the emissions. 
The following key data points are available on a vehicle asset carbon footprint record. 
•	Total fuel use: Sam can view the total fuel usage for a vehicle in gallons and in liters. The values are rolled up from the associated energy use records for the vehicle.
•	Supplemental emissions: Sam can also specify supplemental emissions by scope to manually adjust emissions, if needed. These are added to the calculated total emissions.
•	Greenhouse gas emissions: Sam can see the auto calculated values for Total Scope 1, Total Scope 2 Market-Based, Total Scope 2 Location-Based, Total Scope 3 Upstream and Total Scope 3 Downstream Emissions (tCO₂e) for the associated source. 
 
Calculations for Vehicle Emissions
The following information is available on a vehicle asset energy use record for a fleet vehicle asset source such as NTO’s company shuttle. 
Field 	Value 
Name 	Miami Shuttle Fueling Receipt 2/3/21
Reporting Period 	2/3/2021 - 2/3/2021 
Distance 	100 miles
Fuel Type 	Diesel 
Fuel Consumption 	100 liters
 
First, Net Zero Cloud converts the fuel consumption to gallons. 100 liters = 26.42 gallons. 
Next, let’s look at the information in the  other emissions factor set record. The fuel conversion factors - DEFRA EPA 2018 record has an associated other emissions factor item record that holds the emissions factors for Diesel. The values are as follows. 
Field 	 Value 
CO₂ Emissions Factor 	9.75 g/US gal 
N₂O Emissions Factor 	0.3 g/US gal 
CH₄ Emissions Factor 	0.12 g/US gal 
So, for 26.4 gallons of Diesel, the mass of CO₂, N₂O, and CH₄ generated is calculated by applying the emissions factors. 
•	CO2: 26.42*9.75*0.001 = 0.257568 kg 
•	N20: 26.4*0.3*0.001 = 0.007925 kg 
•	CH4: 26.4*0.12*0.001 = 0.003170 kg 
Note that the contribution of N₂O and CH₄ emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents is not 1:1. This equivalence is obtained from the global warming potential (GWP) values referred to in the other emissions factors record. 
•	N₂O GWP = 265 
•	CH₄ GWP = 28 
Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = {CO₂ Emissions (Kg) /1000} + {N₂O Emissions (Kg) /1000 *N₂O GWP} + {CH₄ Emissions (Kg)/1000 * CH₄ GWP} 
                                             = {0.257568/1000} + {0.007925/1000*265} + {0.003170/1000*28} = 0.0024 
 
Similar calculations are carried out for private jets by referring to the fuel conversion factors for jet fuel and other values, such as aircraft fuel economy. 
What’s Next?
Let’s pause for a moment to understand what Sam has done so far. He has listed the stationary and vehicle asset sources for NTO’s carbon accounting process and he has decoded the various emissions factors used for estimation of tCO₂e emissions for these assets. Next, he has created energy use records for stationary and vehicle assets, and he created the required carbon footprint records to aggregate the data. Sam has also looked at the calculations behind the scenes. He is now ready to uncover a few extra details about the carbon accounting process in the next unit.

Explore Additional Features for Carbon Accounting 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	List the stages of carbon footprints. 
•	Explain record locking and carbon footprint recalculation. 
•	Explain why you need an annual carbon inventory record. 
Carbon Footprint Stages
A carbon footprint record is flexible in Net Zero Cloud. Companies can choose the reporting period for carbon footprints and how granular they want footprints to be. For example, Sam has the flexibility to create carbon footprint records that summarize emissions for a single asset for a given year, or for multiple assets across any period. NTO has chosen to create carbon footprints for each stationary and vehicle asset source for a single year. 
Sam notices that on all carbon footprint records there’s a field called the Footprint Stage. Carbon footprints for NTO go through a detailed process of approval and audit. All data is validated within Sam’s team and calculations are completed. Then, both internal and external audits are conducted to ensure that all emissions are correctly accounted for. 
Net Zero Cloud makes this process easy to manage. The Footprint Stage field comes with logical values that help Sam move the record through each stage with a simple click! Let’s take a closer look at these values and what they mean. 
 
The following picklist values are available by default for the Footprint Stage field on a carbon footprint record in Net Zero Cloud, but your admin can customize the stages as per company requirements. 
•	Emissions source confirmation: The user confirms whether to include an individual building or vehicle asset in the carbon footprint.
•	Data collection: All energy consumption records are entered and associated with the assets.
•	Validation: The user determines that the initial data looks correct, including the input and the calculated emissions output based on the associated emissions factors.
•	Renewable energy allocation: The renewable energy allocation information is added to the energy consumption records.
•	Internal audit: An internal auditor validates the energy consumption and carbon footprint information.
•	External audit: An external auditor validates the carbon footprint information.
•	Completed: The validated carbon footprint record is marked as complete. 
 
The best part is that Sam can easily manage multiple carbon footprint records through their lifecycle using the Kanban view. This view makes the workflow better because Sam can visually track where each record is in the footprinting process. And when one stage is complete, he simply drags the record and drops it to the column of the next stage! 
 
Do More with Carbon Footprints
The flexibility doesn’t end there. Sam explores a few additional features that make carbon accounting even easier with Net Zero Cloud. 
Lock the Carbon Footprint Record 
To ensure that the carbon footprint record is not updated accidentally or by an automated process, Sam locks the carbon footprint record, which also locks the child, or associated, energy use records. This prevents the carbon footprint record and all the energy use records associated with it from being recalculated. It also prevents accidental updates to the records during audits. Locked carbon footprint records can be unlocked later. 
 
Recalculate the Carbon Footprint 
The carbon footprint record can become out of sync with the energy use records that are associated with it, such as when emissions factors change or when the energy consumption numbers are updated in a child energy use record. If the emissions factors have changed for any associated energy use records, Sam can click Recalculate on a carbon footprint to reset and recalculate values from all attached energy use records. When a child energy use record is added or updated, Net Zero Cloud automatically recalculates all the child energy use records and the carbon footprint record. No manual updating and tracking needed! 
 
 
Sam can modify, lock, unlock, and recalculate carbon footprint records that he created. But if he wants to perform these actions on records that are created by other users, he must have Modify All permission on them. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to gain the required permissions. 
Why Do You Need a Carbon Inventory?
Sam now understands all the essentials of carbon accounting. Since all the work’s done and it’s the end of the year, Sam wants to give himself a pat on the back and a well-deserved break. But before that, he notices that there’s one last item left to be ticked off his to-do list. Sam can create an annual emissions inventory record for any given year to roll up all carbon footprints for all sources and activities. The aim for NTO is to set a science-based target and develop an emissions reduction target in line with Science-Based Targets Initiative’s (SBTi) criteria. The carbon inventory is the first step towards getting started on that path. 
On an annual emissions inventory record, Sam can see granular information for each emissions source type, broken up by category and activity and even the percentage of each emissions type towards the total emissions. Emissions from a Carbon Footprint record are aggregated into the annual emissions inventory if they meet the following conditions: 
•	The Reporting Year on a footprint record matches the Year that is selected during inventory creation. 
•	The Footprint Stage on a footprint record matches the Carbon Footprint Stage that is selected during inventory creation. 
•	The Annual Emissions Inventory on a footprint record is associated with an inventory record. 
 
Previously, Sam would have had to do all these calculations manually. That could have taken months! Salesforce Net Zero Cloud enables easy recording and traceability of calculated emissions. Moreover, Sam can also use this data to further forecast NTO’s emissions for upcoming years accurately. Sam can truly have a restful time-off! 
Sum It Up
Salesforce Net Zero Cloud solves many of the issues with traditional carbon accounting: incomplete or missing records, manual data tracking in multiple spreadsheets, and unstructured data. The time it took NTO to collect, calculate, and audit data has been reduced from months to weeks. 
With all the data flowing directly onto one platform, Sam can efficiently quantify the carbon footprint across scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and reduce NTO’s carbon footprint, getting them closer to their net zero goal. Following in his footsteps, you too can formulate a climate action plan from a single source of truth, and easily measure and manage your plans with your trusted partner, the Net Zero Cloud.

Learn About Digital Engagement 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Explain what digital engagement is.
•	Describe key benefits of digital customer service.
•	Identify the differences between digital service and digital transformation.
What Is Digital Engagement? 
Ursa Major Solar’s business continues to grow. The company can’t keep enough solar panels in stock to sell to all its customers—and potential customers—who keep trying to contact them. But contacting Ursa Major Solar is difficult. At least that’s what Sita Nagappan-Alvarez, the CEO of Ursa Major Solar, keeps hearing. After a large deal closed with a residential builder, the client said, “If I could’ve reached you or learned about your business sooner, I would’ve bought twice as many panels...”
Salesforce Research states, "As customers spend more time at home with their devices and less time in stores or places of work, the shift toward digital channels has accelerated. At the same time, the share of organizations offering in-person customer service plummeted, and channels such as online chat, messenger apps, and video support saw double-digit adoption gains. Eighty-seven percent of service professionals say customers have increased their use of digital channels during the pandemic." Gone are the days when an email or phone call is enough. To keep customers and potential customers happy, you must engage with them in the digital realm.
Enter, digital engagement. It’s a term that describes how companies engage with customers across all digital touchpoints, while providing a consistent customer experience. Typically, a customer’s journey includes marketing, selling, and servicing in a way that lets them switch between multiple channels without interrupting a positive experience.
 
A typical digital customer journey for Ursa Major Solar might look like this:
1.	A new campaign to promote solar panels on the web or on multiple social media channels (Marketing Cloud Engagement).
2.	Leads and opportunities from the campaign are captured and every stage of the deal is tracked and analyzed until the sale of the solar panel is complete (Sales Cloud & Commerce Cloud).
3.	After the solar panel is purchased, customers receive service reminders as texts on their mobile devices, review service agreements from a website, and reach out to support via chatbots, web chat, social media channels, and more (Service Cloud).
Each part of the journey—no matter where the customer is at—is optimized with automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to make sure that a positive experience is delivered consistently.
Digital Transformation 
Sita knows that emerging technology is transforming customers’ expectations. Customers ask virtual assistants to play their morning playlist, use applications to order their favorite foods, call for a ride, or navigate traffic. The reason these experiences are sticky is that emerging technologies like AI are embedded into these apps to power customer experiences. To stay competitive, companies need to incorporate digital technologies into their customer experiences.
Customers expect to interact with businesses the same way they do in their personal lives—on mobile devices, with SMS messaging, social media, and more. If customers aren’t receiving the experiences they expect, they can easily take their business elsewhere. The rise of social media and review websites give customers more of a voice. In the past, customers might have shared a bad experience with friends and family, but with social media, they can broadcast bad experiences with the world.
Digital transformation—converting ink-on-paper records to digital formats—encourages businesses to reconsider how to deliver customer experiences, and question traditional ideas of teams and departments. That doesn’t mean support agents need to run marketing campaigns, but it can mean knocking down walls between departments. A social media presence can encompass marketing, selling, and servicing, tied together by a digital platform that captures customer information, creates personalized journeys, and routes questions from customers or potential customers to the right support agents.
Benefits of Digital Service 
Sita knows that digital transformation has reshaped how companies approach customer service. The old model was to wait for customers to find you, whether in person or by calling a toll-free number. But the rise of digital communication has changed service much like it’s changed advertising, media, and news.
The practice of providing excellent service hasn’t changed. But the process of answering a question, looking up relevant data, and offering a solution has become much more efficient with mobile devices and multiple communication channels. Sita can see that embracing social media, automation, and AI will help build better relationships with new and existing customers.

Sita is impressed with Service Cloud’s areas to support the digital realm. But she wonders where email and phone fits in. “Aren’t email and phones digital?” Maria assures her that email and telephone are traditional channels for service that often fall into the realm of digital engagement. Both email and telephony are part of multichannel service available with Service Cloud.
Digital Engagement Options with Service Cloud 
Maria dives a little deeper into specific Service Cloud features and how they help with customer engagement. Learning about these features will help Sita and the service team decide what to implement.
Service Area	Description
Service Console	•	The Service Console is a centralized interface that lets agents see all relevant information about customers and helps them respond to cases across multiple channels, simultaneously.
•	The console integrates with productivity tools, routing mechanisms, useful knowledge, predictive intelligence, data from other systems, and more to provide a unified workspace to support customers on any device, from any location, across any channel.
•	All service features and channels connect with the console. And, since the console is a Lightning app, it’s easy to customize and scale with components and drag-and-drop tools.
Salesforce Mobile app	•	Salesforce Mobile app is for customer service on the go, and it’s available on both iOS and Android devices.
•	The app gives you real-time access to the same case and customer information that you see on the console but is organized for getting work done from your mobile device.
Omni-Channel	•	Omni-Channel routes any type of incoming work item to the most qualified, available support agents in the console. Monitor agent workloads and the status of work items routed by Omni-Channel.
•	Agents can raise flags on work items when they need assistance from a supervisor, and supervisors can monitor conversations between agents and customers, and send helpful messages that only the agent sees.
•	Supervisors can also respond to incoming support requests by changing queues as needed and can update agent skills quickly.
Voice & Call Center	•	Voice & Call Center integrates phone call capabilities with the console so that you can use your computer as a phone. Whenever a customer calls, their information appears front and center for agents so that they have everything they need to help the customer.
•	No more time spent searching, scrolling, or clicking for information about a customer. Make outgoing calls directly from the console, and report on call outcome, duration, and more.
Email-to-Case	•	Email-to-Case automatically converts emails sent to an address you specify to cases in the console.
•	Email exchanges between customers and agents are tracked to see history and sentiment and lead to the quickest resolution.
Web-to-Case	•	Web-to-Case lets you add a submission form on your website so that customers can submit cases directly to the console for agents.
•	Since you choose the case fields on the form, any workflows, assignments, and responses are automatically triggered.
Experience Cloud Sites	•	Sites help you share information and collaborate with customers, partners, or employees. Whether you call it a self-service web portal, a help forum, a support site, or something else, an online community lets your agents share approved content and connect with others from the console.
•	Use easy point-and-click tools with Lightning templates to create branded collaboration spaces for various business purposes.
Messaging	•	Messaging lets customers start conversations with your company by sending texts to your designated phone number or sending Facebook Messenger messages to your Facebook page. Incoming messages are displayed in the console, where agents can accept messages and start chatting.
•	Agents can also proactively reach out to customers on these channels to keep them updated or use automation to send customers messages when Salesforce records change, such as when cases are closed.
Embedded Service	•	Embedded Service helps you add personalized service to connected apps for mobile and the web. Create and monitor cases from any mobile device for a seamless service experience wherever your customers are located.
•	Set up two-way audio chat for devices so that agents can have context for issues and solve problems directly from the console.
Einstein Bots	•	Einstein Bots are applications that simulate human conversation, either aloud or from text message. Instead of having a conversation with an agent, customers can have a conversation with a computer integrated with an AI technology called Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
•	Whether through typing or talking, a chatbot can connect with a customer to answer routine questions, leaving agents more time to help customers with more complex questions or problems.
Einstein Case Classification	•	Einstein Case Classification uses predictive intelligence on new cases to recommend or populate picklist and checkbox field values based on past data. It uses machine learning, AI technology that determines the values on case fields, to free up time for support agents.
•	More time for support agents means more time spent making customers happy and delivering exceptional experiences.

 

Now that Sita has a better idea of what digital service options are available with Service Cloud, she asks Maria to help her start planning for digital engagement.

Plan for Digital Engagement 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Learn the importance of implementing case management before digital engagement.
•	Begin the planning process for Service Cloud’s digital engagement tools.
•	Understand the importance of content for digital engagement.
Prepare for Digital Service 
Maria knows that adding multiple channels is the second stage of the general setup process for Service Cloud. (See the Service Cloud for Lightning Experience module for a refresher.)
 
Maria understands why she shouldn’t set up channels or digital engagement first: If a customer reaches out for help, but there’s no consistent way to track, route, or respond to their question, who would receive the case to resolve? A customer or agent lost in an unclear case management process makes for an unhappy customer and agent.
Maria is excited about setting up digital engagement features for service. Before she sets up any features, she asks Ursa Major Solar’s service team some questions about how they work. She wants a thousand-foot view into their general processes and requirements before she implements any specific features.
Fundamentals
Question	Answer
Do your agents have a complete view of the customer?	Yes, during our case management implementation, we customized a Service Console to show account, contact, and other records for 360-degree views of customers. The console is ready to support multiple channels.
Are you able to effectively route cases or messaging sessions to the right agents?	Yes, during our case management implementation, we set up some queues, assignment rules, and escalation rules, but we need to look into Omni-Channel.
Omni-Channel routing sounds more robust and can automatically push and prioritize a variety of work to agents, without them picking items from a queue or determining priorities. We definitely need Omni-Channel for better automation and to scale the growth of our service team.
Are you using automation to save time and speed case resolution?	We’re using some of the basic assignment and escalation rules.
However, we’re not using anything like automated conversations with chatbots to answer routine questions online. We’re also not using any kind of AI or machine learning to make automatic field predictions to speed up case resolution. Someone needs to look into self-service, Einstein Bots, and Einstein Case Classification.
Do your agents spend a significant amount of time switching between applications to get customer information or answers?	The console has made it easier for agents to see complete views of customers, but we need to do something about knowledge.
We implemented Salesforce Knowledge, but we need to add the Knowledge component to the console so that automation suggests correct answers to agents while they’re working on cases.
Self-Service
Question	Answer
Where can customers find answers to questions about your products or services? Can they access answers and information on a website or a mobile app?	Currently, we have a Web-to-Case form on our website where customers can submit cases. But that’s it. We’ve been wanting to update our website for a while, but we haven’t made the time.
After reading about Experience Cloud sites, we need something like that online where customers, agents, and experts can collaborate and share ideas. We also need a source of truth for some documents about our solar panels. And adding a chatbot on an Experience Cloud site to answer common questions would help unload some of the most tedious work from our agents.

Information for customers on a mobile app sounds great, but we need a site first, which everyone can access on mobile devices.
Is there a business process—like registering a solar panel—that requires your customers to call an agent? Is there data that can only be accessed over the phone? How can you make this easier to access?	Unfortunately, to register solar panels, customers have to call an agent. Clearly, we need a web presence like an Experience Cloud site where customers can register any of our products online and do so at their own convenience.
Also, since we implemented Salesforce Knowledge, we need to share some of our articles online so that customers can troubleshoot routine issues themselves, 24/7, without having to phone an agent during business hours.
If you already have a knowledge base for your customers, are you using marketing automation to increase engagement and adoption of the portal?	Once we have a self-service site, and set up some social media channels, we will definitely look into message automation to drive traffic and awareness to it. Thank goodness we already have Salesforce Knowledge with some incredibly helpful articles that are ready to share online!
Social Presence
Question	Answer
Do you receive service-related questions on social media? Are the right people responding?	We don’t know. We have no social media presence right now, at least none we’re participating in or responding to. We have to add a variety of social media channels to our digital engagement plans—we have to reach customers where they are at.
Are customers chatting online about themes related to your product or industry?	Ryan De Lyon, our customer service manager, has heard some customers are posting questions about our solar panels on Twitter and Facebook. Since we are not monitoring those channels, we don’t really know what is going on there or how our brand is affected.
Ideally, once we set up social channels, we’d like to contribute to conversations about the solar panel industry and lead a few talking points to build new relationships and drive more business.
Are your customers already building online forums of their own to discuss your products or services?	We don’t know—we need to research this topic. A few months ago, one of our agents mentioned that there was a website displaying some of our solar panel manuals with a few comments posted on the site, but we’re not sure what that is about. Sounds like we need to look into it immediately.
Messaging
Question	Answer
Where does most of your customer traffic come from? Is it from mobile or desktop?	We don’t know. We think that most of the people we interact with have mobile phones and use text messaging. Once we have some of our digital channels up and running, like self-service sites or social media, we should post a survey to our customers and try to determine how many of them prefer communicating with us from mobile devices or desktops.
Do you know your percentage of customers using iPhones versus Android?	No, this is another area for a customer survey once we have digital channels set up. The answer will help us learn on which devices to build mobile service apps in the future.
Are your customers using international messaging apps like WeChat or WhatsApp?	Currently, we don’t have any international customers. In the future, however, we hope to expand globally, so this question is important for us as we plan for growth.
Automation & AI
Question	Answer
Do your agents spend time on data entry or repeating steps on every case that they work?	Our agents do type a lot of the same things in the console, but we’re already looking into the console’s Macros and Quick Text features to reduce repetitive tasks.
Macros will help agents select email templates, send emails, and change case statuses all with one click, whereas Quick Text will help agents send a variety of predefined messages to customers so they save time typing the same responses, no matter which channel.
Do you have a list of the top common questions, such as order status or password reset that you get from customers on a regular basis?	Yes, our agents spend a lot of time answering similar questions, especially on order statuses. If we had a self-service site or a text messaging channel where Einstein Bots could answer those questions, our agents could focus on solving more complex issues that require creativity and teamwork.
Do you have any picklist or checkbox fields on cases that machine learning could prefill for agents; any recommendations for knowledge articles or next actions for agents?	Yes, some useful fields to predict are Case Reason, Escalated, and Priority—having those automatically predicted would save agents time and clicks. And, anytime a useful article from our knowledge base could surface to an agent without searching for it is a productivity boost. Also, any kind of AI that suggests next-best actions for agents while they work would be a dream come true. Offloading some decisions during customer interactions could only help agents focus on building better relationships.
Digital Content Considerations 
As Maria plans for digital engagement, she sees a unique thread that ties a number of features together—content. She wonders, “Do we have the right content ready to help agents and customers across multiple channels?” Based on the answers to the planning questions above, she knows the answer is no.
Traditionally, content is something only marketers, advertisers, or media agencies created. Support agents worked with a limited content choice of case open or case closed. If service teams created content, it was usually a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page on a website. With chatbots, SMS messaging, social media posts, or conversational interfaces from buttons all the way to online payments, content is a big piece of how to deliver service. Content is also a critical component for closing the loop on marketing, selling, and servicing. Content creation and curation requires a new set of skills for service. The teams at Ursa Major Solar will have to give considerable thought to the content that appears in each stage of a basic digital customer journey.
Next Steps for Digital Engagement 
Now that Sita and Maria have answers to their questions, they take a step back to prioritize Service Cloud feature implementations. There are a lot of features they can set up, so they ask themselves a few more high-level questions.
•	Which channel should we set up first, second, and so on?
•	Are our agents trained to communicate on those channels?
•	Will agents cover all channels or will some agents cover specific channels?
•	Will the channel take into account international customers and multiple languages?
•	Are our console and case management processes ready to support each new channel and automation or AI?
All of these questions should be asked before adding a new digital channel to a multichannel support model. Once Maria gets the answers she’s looking for, she can begin setting up specific service features for Ursa Major Solar. It looks like there’s a lot more Trailhead in Maria’s future.

Get Started with Web3 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Define Web3.
•	Describe each evolution of the internet.
•	Describe why Web3 is important for the future.
Welcome to the World Wide Web 
A lot has changed since the advent of the internet in the early 1990s... The internet is alive. It’s an ever-changing technology that has become our default context. And as the internet has evolved—from a way to link documents to an accessible information system to an interconnected social network with millions of active users daily—the way we relate to each other and the world around us has changed. 
Since its advent, the internet has enabled billions of users worldwide to learn, share, and connect globally for free. But millions of people can share and manipulate all of the information out there. This creates the enormous gaps in transparency, privacy, and security we experience with today’s internet ecosystem. This problem can theoretically be solved with the next generation of the internet, Web 3.0, often referred to as Web3. 
How we connect with our friends, family, and coworkers has drastically shifted since the early ’90s, taking us from in-person to virtual, making the digital world more central to our everyday lives. We’re now seeing a new digital economy emerging with users at the center. Many believe we’re entering the next era, where the emerging technology and use cases we see today will continue to evolve and be played out over years and decades.
There’s a lot to unpack here. That’s why we created this module: to help make sense of where we’ve been, where we’re headed next, and what it all means.
Before we get to the details about Web3, let’s review some basics. Let’s start from the beginning. 
The Evolution of the Internet 
The evolution of the web is often divided into three stages: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0. 
In the beginning, Web1 (1990 to 2000) democratized access to information. It was the first iteration of the world wide web. Most of us were consumers of content. And the creators were typically developers who built websites that contained information mainly in text or image format. Data and content were served from a static file system rather than a database, and sites didn’t have much interactivity at all. It was the Web of Read.
Most of us have experienced the wonders of the web in its current form, which is referred to as Web2 (2000 to 2021). This stage of the internet took Web1 further by democratizing connections and transactions. In this era, the simplicity built into the interfaces and applications enabled anyone to become a creator. It’s the Web of Read and Write.
As we experience the beginning of the Web3 era (2021 and beyond), applications will not run on a single server or store data in a single database owned by central authorities. Instead, Web3 applications will either run on blockchains, decentralized networks of many peer-to-peer servers (nodes), or a combination of the two. Web3 has the potential to democratize participation on the internet, enabling people to Read, Write, and Own both their data and digital identity.

Why Web3 Matters 
Web3 is a point of evolution beyond where we have been operating. It’s an extension of Web2, which incorporates the advanced technologies we see coming to fruition today. The idea of Web3 is not only to fuel the formation of the metaverse and expansion of cryptocurrency, but to touch on other major industries in our globally interconnected world. The ultimate goal of Web3 is to create a more connected and open digital world.
Web3 does not require “permission,” meaning that central authorities will not decide who uses what services. Nor is there a need for an intermediary to facilitate virtual transactions between parties. Web3 theoretically better protects user privacy in certain ways because it’s these authorities and go-betweens in Web2 doing most of the data collection. 
There are a number of advantages that Web3 has the potential to offer.
•	Decentralization: Intermediaries would be removed from the equation, and blockchains would provide a transparent platform where the rules are unbreakable and data is publicly recorded.
•	Ownership of data: End users will regain control of data by creating a public record of all their activity on the blockchain. Information could then be shared on a case-by-case and permissioned basis.
•	Potential for reduction in hacks and data breaches: As more businesses and enterprises enter the space, there will be a large need for added security. This new technology can provide enhanced security because data will be decentralized and distributed. With further development of the rules and regulations, there is potential for reduction in large-scale hacks and data breaches where hackers would need to turn off the entire network of servers and record every transaction on the blockchain to access information.
•	Permissionless blockchains: Anyone could create an address and interact with the network. Users will not be barred on account of geography, income, gender, orientation, or a host of other sociological and demographic factors.
While still in its early years, the mission behind Web3 is to create a decentralized web that creates new types of ownership, new ways of building trust and collaboration, and opens the doors to new possibilities. It has the potential to change how we interact with the web in the upcoming decades. Web3 is built on blockchain technology that validates user data, creates transaction transparency, and provides more secure payment options. 
Where Do We Go Next? 
The future is a decentralized, global marketplace. In the next unit, discover how Web3 is transforming industries and impacting businesses, society, and individuals alike.

Understand the Technologies Behind Web3 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe main components of Web3.
•	Define NFT, blockchain, and cryptocurrency.
The Building Blocks of Web3: Blockchain 
In today’s digital-first world, someone can buy a tweet, develop digital land, pay without a traditional currency, and track down data to the 1s and 0s, all from the comfort of their personal device. The innovative technology that enables this transparency is the blockchain. 
A blockchain is a system of recording information on a tamper-resistant digital ledger distributed across its entire network of computer systems. Each block on the chain contains transaction data that records each transaction on participants’ ledgers. The transactions are public and cannot be changed, tampered with, or erased once published. 
The idea of a blockchain came to life as a solution for accurate and fixed time stamps, similar to that of a notary. This fundamental aspect is still present in technology today. 
Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), where these transactions are programmable, immutable, and anonymous. 
 
Blockchains are constantly growing as blocks (transactions recording verified information) are added to the chain through every transaction. This increases the security of the entire ledger. The more blocks on the chain, the more secure the entire system becomes. This also allows regulators to easily identify if one of the blocks was tampered with, making hacking nearly impossible. 
This is a young sector, and norms and standards are still emerging, including key issues such as sustainability. Companies, including Salesforce, have an opportunity to lead with values, and shape positive norms and benchmarks for using NFT and blockchain technology sustainably.
One key challenge in this space is related to sustainability. Many of the first generation cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin) rely on proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains, which require the use of energy (that is, work) to perform transactions. This has resulted in significant energy consumption and carbon emissions, with Bitcoin consuming as much power per year as the country of Thailand (as of February 2022), according to the Digiconomist.
The industry is continuing to address sustainability issues as their technology evolves, as we’re seeing with new and upcoming proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. Based on current models, it’s believed that PoS blockchains drastically reduce the energy consumption seen by current-state PoW blockchains (by as much as 99.95% according to Olga Kharif’s Bye-Bye, Miners! How Ethereum’s Big Change Will Work, which appeared on Bloomberg.com in 2021). Additionally, e-waste from PoW blockchain use may be eliminated by switching to PoS, which does not rely on physical hardware for securing the network.
Companies and organizations exploring blockchain applications should put in place clear sustainability strategies to quantify, minimize, neutralize, and disclose environmental impacts resulting in net zero emissions while driving increased sustainability in the sector more broadly.
Now that we’ve discussed the power, purpose, and impact of Web3, let’s look at how this technology is utilized in cryptocurrencies. 
What Makes a Currency a Cryptocurrency? 
The simple answer is that a cryptocurrency is a nontraditional digital currency built on the blockchain. To expand on this, let’s look at how cryptocurrencies came to be. 
On October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto sent a paper to a group of cryptographers familiar with blockchain technology outlining a new form of “electronic cash” called Bitcoin. In this paper he outlined how the distributed ledger technology (DLT) was combined with several other technologies and concepts to create the cryptocurrencies of today. These digital currencies are essentially electronic cash protected through cryptographic mechanisms instead of a central authority like a bank, company, or government. 
Blockchain technology is the foundation of modern cryptocurrencies, most commonly referred to as crypto. They got their name because of the heavy usage of cryptographic functions paired with the decentralized ledgers. 
This system allows someone to purchase, trade, and own a variety of things, including NFTs and real estate. And with more integration into our financial system, many more applications can be expected. 
Next, let’s explore the role of NFTs in the Web3 ecosystem. 
What Is an NFT? 
An NFT (nonfungible token) is a digital asset that represents either digital or physical objects like art, music, event tickets, videos, and more. They’re backed by smart contracts, which allows them to have distinctive properties such as secondary sales and transferable value. 
Here’s how NFTs work.
•	NFTs exist on a blockchain, which is a distributed public ledger that records transactions.
•	NFTs are blockchain agnostic, meaning they can be built on a variety of blockchains.
•	An NFT is created, or “minted” from digital objects that can represent both tangible and intangible items.
•	An NFT can have only one owner at a time, and an NFT’s unique data makes it easy to verify the creator and owner, and enables token transfer between owners.
•	The creator writes a smart contract that defines the use and royalties of the NFT.
The Value of NFTs 
So why buy an NFT, since anyone can copy an image or a video with an internet search and a few clicks? Well, buying an NFT gives proof of ownership of a unique digital asset, which can include virtual goods, in-game items, digital art, and more. Because they are built on the blockchain, the transaction and ownership history is public. This information is validated and records authenticity of the seller and the sole ownership. Just like with a physical asset, this can be collected, traded, or sold. In the case of digital art or when purchasing NFTs in secondary marketplaces, buyers should follow best practices to avoid potential scams and other risks. (More on this in a later unit.)
This technology enables trust and transparency between the buyer and seller by having full access to the historical transactions. The transparency provided by the public records can give the buyer insight into the seller's transaction history. As this technology develops, we’ll see companies creating products that will verify a seller or provide a risk rating based on past digital interactions. 
Anyone can search online and find an image, video, or NFT for that matter, and download it to a device. But that’s just saving a copy of the file, not obtaining rights to the digital ownership of the file. For example, there are a lot of copies of Van Gogh’s Starry Night painting, but there’s only one original Starry Night. In theory, NFTs offer collectors the ability to own the digital rights to a piece of art, similar to owning the original Starry Night. (Note: This does not account for creators who copy and repost the original artist’s work as their own. These artists are infringing on copyright and can face serious penalties.)
Brand-new experiences are being built around rare digital and physical goods through the use of NFTs. Given that any digital thing can be an NFT, there are several possible use cases. Some companies have already capitalized on this idea, doing things such as launching an NFT system to verify the authenticity of sneakers, or creating NFTs from video clips of landmark sports moments so fans can own the best plays.
To demonstrate NFTs’ utility, here are a few more use cases. We may continue to see more as time and technology progress.
•	Gaming asset: NFTs can be used as characters in video games and possess gamification capabilities. For example, games have allowed players to purchase NFTs that serve as their game avatars. And as players play, they can earn more NFTs, such as an ultra-rare shield to help them in battle or a new accessory to deck out their avatar.
•	Key: NFTs can act as key to unlocking content, like a subscription to a sports or news magazine. Only the holders of the NFT are able to access the articles, updates, and statistics in the publication.
•	Digital twin: NFTs can be purely digital; however, some projects have allowed the creation of digital twins. This can be something like offering virtual clothes that can be worn in the metaverse or sending an identical physical object to NFT owners.
•	IP ownership: Projects can allow members to own the intellectual property of their NFT. The owner doesn't have to ask the NFT creator to use their avatar—they have the ability to create an entire business around the NFT.
•	Governance/voting: NFTs can give owners voting rights on upcoming promotional merchandise and new platform/product releases, among other things.
NFTs can create authenticity, establish value, democratize access to global markets, and build community. Let’s take a deeper look at how NFTs use smart contracts and wallets. 
Smart Contracts and Wallets 
How does someone actually use cryptocurrency to buy an NFT? Let’s start by understanding how these transactions are tracked with smart contracts and how users employ wallets to buy and hold onto their NFTs.
First let’s go over a few NFT-related terms. 
Smart contracts: These are simply computer programs (a few lines of code), stored on a blockchain, that run when predetermined conditions are met. They can be viewed as an application of Web3. They’re typically used to automate the execution of an agreement (or contract), so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action, when certain conditions are met.
Wallets: A wallet is an app (or plugin), which enables users to access/retrieve, send, and receive digital assets. When a user acquires cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, they can store it in a wallet and from there use it to make transactions. There are two types of wallets.
•	A custodial wallet is one created and secured by someone other than the true owner—for example, an account set up on Coinbase.
•	A noncustodial wallet is one consumers create, own, and manage themselves. They often live directly within browsers (hot) or on offline devices (cold storage). Users self-manage security.
Smart contracts are used to protect buyers and sellers with automated contracts that are programmed to execute when certain conditions are met. These agreements can’t be changed or disputed once executed because smart contracts are immutable, distributed, and public. 
With the ability to track when and to whom all NFTs are sold, smart contracts make purchasing NFTs at scale possible. This creates many possibilities, like enabling royalties for the original creator of an NFT, and offering protection for buyers.
To actually purchase an NFT, a buyer needs a wallet. There are many kinds of wallets, both custodial and noncustodial, each with pros and cons. Metamask, for example, is a noncustodial, browser-based wallet that’s currently the most popular to use with OpenSea, a popular NFT marketplace. With the rising popularity of NFTs and marketplaces, buyers should look into which wallet fits their needs best for security, ease of use, and compatibility with their marketplace of choice. 
Wallets enable new capabilities for brands and users to interact. A few new possibilities include: 
•	New identity: Users may connect to a site and then provide access to any relevant information they want to share with the company for personalization. This provides a key to access the data, rather than sharing it.
•	New experiences: In the near future, users may be able to have a wide range of assets in their wallets, essentially creating virtual versions of themselves. These 3D representations will allow them to try clothes on in real time and see the fit on their virtual selves.
•	New ways to sign in: In the future, users may use NFTs on sites rather than passwords. Held in wallets, the NFTs will grant access without the need to remember passwords or have personal information stored in a brand’s network.
Now that you’ve learned about blockchain, crypto, and NFTs, let’s explore how all of these technologies can come together in the metaverse to create distinct digital experiences made possible through the engagement and participation of the evolving Web3 community.

Build Community in Web3 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe and define the metaverse.
•	Describe main components of the Web3 community.
•	Explain the utility of DAOs and dApps in building community
Where Worlds Collide: The Metaverse 
As we’ve discussed, we’re in the early days of a new version of the internet called Web3. It’s being built on trusted, decentralized technology accessible to all. Platforms, apps, and data won't belong to large platforms—they’ll belong to users. 
Some people are calling this new internet the metaverse. The metaverse is a new reality that reimagines how we interact with the world around us. Playing Fortnite or roaming around Roblox are great examples of Web2 metaverses, the difference is that the Web3 metaverse is backed by the chain. 
The terms metaverse and Web3 have been used interchangeably, but they have inherent differences. According to Oxford Languages, the metaverse is “a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.” Users will only be able to jump between digital worlds with ownership of their assets intact if the metaverse is operating on a decentralized platform. 
Web3 enables a more equitable metaverse, allowing for true ownership (and interoperability) across many metaverses/gamescapes and virtual realities. For example, a sword bought for one game could now be used in another.
The metaverse is where the Web3 community comes together to connect, learn, game, and engage with people around the world. 
Community Comes First 
Community and collaboration is central to Web3, providing a foundation that improves the likelihood of success and maintains relevance of a project, idea, event, and so forth. 
The strength of an online community’s network is not only determined by how many people make up the community, but also the participants’ engagement on social media and community discussion forums. The decentralized nature of blockchain emphasizes the importance of community as a pillar of the next generation of internet. 
So where are these communities if everything is decentralized? The short answer is, they’re everywhere around the world. They’re communicating via messaging platforms and social media, and organizing live events to attend together. Having tremendous reach and engagement across Discord, Twitter, and Telegram, these communities of diverse individuals are able to have a real impact. Since the foundation of these communities are messaging based, users are more engaged with content on the platform and have deeper connection to the people and content. They’re participants rather than simply users.
One way communities come together in Web3 is through DAOs and dApps. Keep reading to learn about these two functions of Web3. 
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations 
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a group or collective made up of individuals who organize around a common purpose. They’re managed by smart contracts, powered by tokens, have a shared treasury, and are governed by community voting. Examples range from the development of open-source software to a crowd-sourced attempt at purchasing the US Constitution. 
DAOs are to Web3 what open-source projects are to Web1. DAOs are made up of people who share common goals and objectives, visions, and values. These groups unite to produce products or deliver services, and members/contributors are rewarded for their contributions to the collective.
DAOs represent a framework for community and shared responsibility—what companies represent in the context of Web2. This framework might very well function as the underpinning for the future of work (the next era of the gig economy).
Decentralized Apps (dApps) 
Next, we have decentralized apps (dApps), which are applications (software), built on a decentralized network (blockchain), which combine a smart contract and a front-end (UI). dApps use the same front end as Web2 apps, but rely on blockchain technology rather than centralized servers or other centralized databases. 
Web2 applications like Instagram or Twitter differ from Web3 applications in that they’re owned/operated by centralized authorities (for example, companies like Meta). 
In the case of Web3 applications, no central authority or governing body has absolute control or governance rights when it comes to data recorded on/by the network. Instead, the data is verified by a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers.
In the future, we can expect that media, gaming, and finance industries will see a significant shift toward dApps, as they provide greater ownership for creators, enable play-to-earn, and create faster and more secure transactions.
Bringing It All Together 
Each of these technologies—blockchain, cryptocurrencies, metaverses, DAOs, dApps—are paving the way for significant changes in our personal and work lives. But it’s the combination of these technologies that provides the foundation for Web3. 
We can easily imagine a bright and shiny future powered by the increasing use cases and applications of blockchain technologies, but if we’re not careful, these can be a destabilizing force for society. 
The same way that the two previous internet revolutions had positive and negative impacts, new technologies in Web3 carry potentially negative repercussions. Putting the control in the wrong hands can alter our future in undesirable ways if the goals are not aligned with the common good. 
It’s a new era. Governments, business leaders, the scientific community, and citizens need to work together to define the paths, lead with values, and direct the technologies of Web3 to create sustainable applications and a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive society. Read on to learn more about approaching Web3 with ethics, trust, and safety at the forefront.

Learn About Trust and Safety in Web3 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Articulate the ethical principles for Salesforce’s Web3 product innovation. 
•	Identify potential downsides and risks in Web3. 
•	Identify strategies and best practices for keeping safe and secure in the Web3 space. 
Background
Blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs are driving innovation and commerce at scale. As with any early stage technology, potential outcomes can be unknown. Which is why it’s critical for those innovating in this space to do so in a responsible, ethical way. If we want Web3 to improve the lives of everyone within the ecosystem, not just a handful of people at the top, we need to design it in a values-led way.  
Principles-Led Product Innovation 
At Salesforce, we believe that products in the Web3 space should be created with these principles in mind. 
1.	Trust and Security. We will embed best-in-class brand and consumer protections, identifying—and preventing the use of the product for—fraud, force, or fear. 
2.	Sustainability. We commit to quantify, disclose, minimize, and neutralize environmental impacts resulting in net zero emissions while driving increased sustainability in the sector more broadly. 
3.	Equality. We will provide guidance and guardrails to ensure fairness, diversity, and empowerment of customers and consumers. 
4.	Accountability. We will empower the end-user with explainable governance and engage stakeholders in ongoing evaluation. 
5.	Integrity and Transparency. We commit to share clear, precise communication about the product and create trusted experiences and marketplaces where safety is top of mind. 
We believe that by leading with our values, we can help guide this new space in a positive direction. 
The Challenges of an Emerging Web3 Landscape
While there is much to be excited about when it comes to Web3, there’s also reason to proceed with a degree of caution as the space grows and matures. Here are some of the known and potential risks within the ecosystem.  
Speculative Bubbles 
The Dutch tulip mania from 1634 to 1637 is the classic example of a significant difference between the financial value of an asset and its intrinsic value. It created a speculative bubble, which saw the price of tulips reach incredibly high levels. There have been many such bubbles since, and some claim that Web3 is in such a moment. 
Price Volatility 
Assets in Web3 are susceptible to price volatility, since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be argued to have no intrinsic value. And unlike other traditional currencies, they aren’t backed by a government or central bank. As a result, their price is driven only by supply and demand. As their value increases, this success may attract new investors, sending prices upward. On the flip side, a negative event or even a tweet can drive prices downward. 
Lack of Diversity 
NFTs sit at the intersection of two historically white and male dominated industries: visual art and crypto. The bulk of NFT sales—roughly 77%—are flowing to male creators while only 5% of sales go to female artists. Similarly, it’s posited that the average NFT purchaser is a 38-year-old male who makes over $100,000/year. This poses an issue for promoting equality and inclusion. If most of the NFT community is male and white, there is market pressure to create NFTs that mirror this population and create barriers to entry for nonwhite, nonmale folks to get involved in the space.  
Lack of Privacy 
One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is it allows for anonymity. Connecting one’s identity to a wallet is optional, and many people prefer to keep their cryptocurrency wallet address private for good reason. Imagine if, when you sent digital payment to a lunch partner for your half of the meal, they could now see every other transaction you’d ever made—and not just on that platform, but the ones you made with your credit card, bank transfer, or other apps, and with no option to set the visibility of the transfers to “private.”  
Immutability 
Another feature of blockchains is their immutability: Once data is written to the blockchain, it’s there forever. While this has many useful applications, such as for storing transaction records, it can be a challenge for user-created data, particularly when considering online abuse and harassment. If someone stores harmful, inflammatory or hateful material on a blockchain, it cannot be removed. The platforms might be petitioned to hide the content, but the offensive content would still remain on the chain. 
Lack of Third-Party Protection 
Third-party intermediaries, like banks or credit unions, play a critical role in safeguarding customers’ interests. Banks, for example, have ways of detecting activity by malicious actors, and consumers can challenge fraudulent transactions on their credit cards. When transactions take place without a third party, customers have no one to whom they can appeal for help. For example, if someone loses their private key—which functions like a password—then owners can no longer access their wallets, with no recourse. In January 2021, The New York Times reported that $140 billion worth of bitcoin is locked in wallets whose private keys have been lost or forgotten. 
The Early Days of Regulation
Today, cryptocurrencies and NFTs are largely exempt from legal and financial regulation, which means there is little or no protection for those who create, invest, or trade in them.  
For example: 
Data Hosting and Storage: An NFT and the digital asset it represents are usually stored separately. The NFT is stored on the blockchain and contains information about where the digital asset is located, but the NFT could be deleted or the server hosting it could fail or be hacked. This would make the NFT worth little or nothing—and the law has not yet addressed what rights the NFT owner would have in such a situation. 
Data Protection: NFTs may contain personal information that is subject to data protection laws. Some of these laws—like GDPR (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation)—allow individuals to erase or amend their personal data. However, NFTs are linked to the blockchain, where that is impossible (immutability!). These issues of security and data sharing for NFTs have so far received little consideration. 
Intellectual Property Rights: The buyer of an NFT may erroneously think they own the actual art associated with the NFT. In reality, the only person with the right to copy, distribute, alter, or publicly display the art is its original creator. There is the possibility that a disgruntled NFT buyer may bring legal action if they feel that there was misrepresentation when they were sold the NFT, as they believed they were buying the copyright. 
Taxation: The US and other nations have little or no legislation in this regard, nor any official advice relating to NFTs and tax. While it can be expected that profits and losses relating to NFTs would be liable for capital gains tax, and that the NFTs themselves would be considered assets for the purposes of other taxes—including inheritance tax—the official position has yet to be confirmed. 
Safety and Security in Web3
Beyond the dynamics noted, there are a number of scams and frauds that are perpetrated in the NFT space, and it’s useful to be able to recognize and avoid them. Here are the six most common. 
Type 	Description 
Rug pull 	The originators of a crypto project take the capital raised from a token sale and disappear. 
Pump and dump 	A particular crypto asset is hyped, leading to a short-term spike in the asset’s price as buy orders flood in. The instigators then sell off their holdings, triggering a crash, with other investors left “holding the bag.” 
Wash trading 	The price of a crypto asset is artificially inflated by repeatedly trading it between wallets controlled by the same individual or group. 
Ponzi scheme 	Capital from later investors in a crypto asset is used to pay returns to earlier investors. 
Hacking 	Protocols or wallets are hacked and owners’ crypto assets stolen. 
Phishing 	Attackers use social engineering techniques to trick a target into revealing information that can be used to gain access to their crypto assets. 
Ways to Protect Yourself
How to Spot a Scam 
As a user, the first step of prevention is to keep your eyes peeled for potential signs of scams. Here’s how to recognize some common, dubious tactics.  
•	Phishing: Users get a seemingly legitimate email from a platform or exchange they frequently use, with a malicious link embedded that lures them to make a transaction. Or it may even inject malware that scans for seed phrases stored in laptops. 
•	Hacking: Hackers sometimes airdrop malicious NFTs to user accounts as a Trojan Horse. Interacting with these malicious NFT airdrops prompt the user to sign a message that allows hackers to gain access and drain the account. 
•	FOMO: A cool new project comes up with a timer counting down on the purchase page, inducing serious FOMO (fear of missing out). When the user signs the transaction and makes that purchase, hackers obtain access to their wallets. Unknown to the user, the purchase page was linked to a scam URL. 
Protect Your Seed Phrase and Secure Your Device 
A seed phrase is a group of words that are used to restore a crypto wallet. A seed phrase looks like this: 
rebuild-glow-language-lady-mushroom-poverty-episode-slow-meat-analyst-knee-output-oblige-couch-tilt 
It’s very important to keep this phrase private and secure, since anyone with your seed phrase can use it to take over your wallet. 
This is where hackers come in and use various methods, including social engineering, to try and steal your seed phrase. One form of this is a scam where they pretend to be support staff from a marketplace or crypto business and ask for your details like your seed phrase or Metamask recovery QR code. Even experienced crypto-natives have fallen for these types of scams. Whenever someone asks you for this information, it should immediately set off alarm bells in your head.  
Whatever type of wallet you use, take caution and practice a security-conscious approach to keeping your device and browser clear of any potential malware. This includes doing due diligence on websites you interact with, keeping your software up-to-date with security patches, and ignoring emails, links, or DMs from strangers. 
Best Practices
Now that you’re aware of potential risks, let’s discuss how to mitigate them! Here are our overall best practices for staying safe in the new Web3 reality. 
•	Always visit the original website—a trusted, first-party marketplace—for any sale or offer. 
•	Only download applications and software from the originating source. 
•	If you’re using them, disable direct messages on Telegram and Discord from people who are not on your friends list. 
•	Never click any link sent to you from an unverified source without properly checking it. 
•	Never send your seed phrase to anyone. 
•	Never open an email link that looks suspicious. 
•	Never install any file with a “.exe” or “.scr” extension sent to you by an unknown sender. 
•	Never fill your wallet password and seed phrase into any form that you are not sure of. 
•	Store your cryptocurrency in a cold wallet or have multiple wallets (separating your daily use wallet from the wallet where you keep the bulk of your funds). 
•	Generate your keys securely—on a newly reset, offline device if possible. 
•	Keep your device, such as mobile phone or desktop, clear of malware and update frequently to the latest security patch. 
•	Make sure you interact only with audited smart contracts. 
•	Disconnect your wallet after every transaction. 
•	Be vigilant—always double-check your transactions, recipient addresses, and browser URL. 
•	Use common sense and trust your intuition—if something seems too good to be true, well, it just might be. 
Conclusion
As a company, Salesforce is deeply committed to creating technology with ethics and inclusion built-in—not bolted on. Our Office of Ethical and Humane Use actively partners with our product and engineering teams to approach product development with intention, identifying risks and innovating new solutions with our values at the core. The potential risks should not stop you from exploring and interacting with crypto and NFTs. There’s a world of opportunity out there, but just remember to take the necessary steps to protect yourself and proceed with caution.

Learn Data Privacy Laws and Regulations 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Explain the importance of data privacy. 
•	Describe how privacy laws apply to your organization. 
•	Outline customer expectations regarding privacy. 
Privacy Introduction
As a security professional, it’s important to stay informed of the latest privacy laws that apply to your organization, especially if your organization handles customers’ personal data. Why is this so important? Ensuring your customer and employee data is protected is paramount to establishing and maintaining trust. In this module we’re going to review the tools for implementing an effective privacy program. 
If your organization stores and processes customer data, your customers trust you to protect, use, and process their data securely, in accordance with applicable laws. This data can include personal data such as contact, healthcare, or financial information, or business-related information such as expenditures, marketing, or analytics data. 
Regardless of what type of data you process or store, it’s important to keep it safe. In addition to processing or storing customer data, your organization is accountable for its own data, including knowledge about prospective customers, employee information, financial data, and more. 
So how do you ensure this data is protected? For starters, you should be aware of and follow applicable privacy laws. We get into the details of these privacy laws here. To document compliance with applicable privacy laws and protect yourself and your customers, it’s a good idea to have agreements in place when you’re collecting customer data. These agreements should detail how your organization will keep customer data secure and confidential. As an example, most international airlines are required to attest on their public websites to how they protect a customer’s privacy, what data they collect, and why and how it’s collected, used, assessed, safeguarded, and stored. 
Why Privacy Matters
Let’s step back for a moment and review the concept of privacy and what it means. Privacy relates to how a piece of information—or data— should be managed and protected based on its relative importance. 
Data privacy has become a hot topic lately due to lapses in security and concerns about how companies are using the customer data they collect. Data privacy concerns are particularly important for companies in certain sectors such as finance and healthcare. These sectors contain sensitive information and are typically highly regulated. They also are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks, which if successful may result in not only loss of this data, but also loss of confidence by consumers.  
Let’s look at an example. When you apply for a credit card, you’re typically required to provide your legal name, birthdate, address, government-issued identification number, and annual income. That’s a lot of information! Not only is this information used to verify your identity, but it also allows the credit card company to check your credit history. This information is considered your personal data, and the credit card company is required to put security measures in place to protect it. 
In this example, privacy means that the credit card company is responsible for protecting your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, that they’re transparent about how they use your personal data, that they use the data in accordance with applicable laws, and that you agree to the use of your data for a certain purpose. 
 
Privacy Terminology
Before we dive deeper into privacy laws, let’s review some basic definitions. 
Customer data: The information a customer provides while interacting with a business whether via a website, mobile application, social media, and more. 
Data subject: An individual whose personal data is collected, held, or processed. 
Personal data: The data that is directly attributable to a data subject and can identify an individual such as a name, home address, or personal identifier (for example, passport number). 
Sensitive personal data: Some types of personal data are considered sensitive and are subject to stricter regulation. This may include data about race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation. 
Processing: Any operation or set of operations on data (for example, access, collection, recording, retrieval, copying, storage, disclosure, dissemination, and so on). 
Controller: An individual or entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. 
Processor: An individual or entity that processes personal data on behalf of a controller. 
Custodian (or handler): The individual responsible for the safe custody, transport, and storage of the data, and implementation of business rules.  
Data Protection Authority (DPA): National authorities tasked with the protection of data and privacy as well as monitoring and enforcement of the data protection regulations within the Union. 
Your organization can act as both a processor and a controller, depending on the situation and the data involved. It’s helpful to think of the roles of processor and controller in relation to the allocation of responsibilities between parties. Your customers can be both controllers and processors. However, your organization always acts as a processor when a customer submits data to you and as controller when you determine the means and purposes of processing the data. 
Privacy Laws
Depending on where your organization operates, you may need to adhere to location-specific privacy laws. If your organization operates globally, it’s important to implement policy requirements applicable to the country of operation. For example, if your organization operates in Japan, you are subject to the Act on the Protection of Personal Information. 
Privacy laws exist to protect individuals with respect to their personal data. They also regulate how personal data can and cannot be used. Let’s take a closer look at what privacy laws address. 
•	Whether personal data can be collected and processed 
•	What and how information should be provided around data processing practices 
•	Who can access and use the personal data 
•	How personal data can be processed 
•	How the data should be secured 
•	When to delete or amend the data 
•	Who is allowed to transport or have custody of the data 
•	Where and how personal data can be transferred to other countries 
•	How security incidents are handled 
•	What rights data subjects have regarding their personal data 
Globally, there are two types of privacy laws: comprehensive (applicable to all industries and sectors) and sectoral (applicable to specific industries or sectors). In the US, the federal government has historically taken a sectoral approach. For example, there’s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is the US healthcare privacy law protecting data that reveals the health status of an individual (called protected health information or PHI).  
The only US national privacy law that exists is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which regulates how online companies can collect and use data on children under the age of 13.  
In the absence of a comprehensive national privacy law, several states have taken the initiative to  enact their own privacy legislation, including: 
•	California - California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) 
•	Virginia - Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA) 
•	Connecticut - Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA) 
•	Utah - Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) 
•	Colorado - Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) 
These states have either recently passed their own privacy legislation or are in the process of legislation. And many more states are considering doing the same. By passing their own privacy laws, these states provide their own protection for their constituents. 
In contrast, the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) take a more comprehensive approach through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is the EU’s and EEA’s privacy legislation and applies to all controllers and processors, irrespective of their industry or sector. However, there are also some sector-specific laws in Europe, such as for the telecoms sector. 
While not an exhaustive list, several other countries across the globe–including Japan, Australia, China, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, India, South Africa, and more–operate their own privacy laws, or are working on drafting them. Even though each country may have their own law, most privacy laws across the globe are based on the same core principles. 
•	Fairness and Transparency 
•	Purpose Limitation 
•	Data Minimization 
•	Accuracy 
•	Data Deletion and Retention 
•	Security 
•	Accountability 
•	Individual Rights 
•	International Transfers 
•	Data Privacy Impact Assessments 
We take a closer look at these principles in the next unit. 
Customer Contracts and Service Level Agreements
In addition to complying with privacy laws, organizations include privacy commitments in customer contracts or service level agreements (SLAs). These commitments detail ways your organization can use personal data, including those required by applicable law. 
International Privacy Certifications and Standards
In addition to privacy laws, your organization may also be required to comply with certain certifications and standards that impose comprehensive privacy requirements. These certifications and standards vary by industry, but may include: 
•	International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001/27018, which provide requirements for information security management systems and for protecting personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors 
•	Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, which help companies establish trust and confidence in their service delivery processes and controls 
•	TRUSTe certification, which enables organizations to demonstrate responsible practices consistent with standards for privacy accountability 
•	International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27701, which is an extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy information management. It provides guidelines for the processing of PII and helps organizations establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their Privacy Information Management System (PIMS). 
Privacy Policies
Your organization should abide by the commitments made to customers when you collect personal data from individuals. Also, your organization should maintain a privacy statement on your public website that describes the types of data you collect from users of your websites, and how you use and share that data. The commitments you make in that privacy statement should be similar to the ones you make in the contracts you sign with your customers. The same is true for internal privacy policies and employee notices that detail how you collect, use, share, and process employee data. 
Sum It Up
You now have a better understanding of privacy concepts, laws, and customer expectations. In the next unit, we cover privacy principles and how you can apply them to protect your organization.

Learn Data Privacy Laws and Regulations 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Explain the importance of data privacy. 
•	Describe how privacy laws apply to your organization. 
•	Outline customer expectations regarding privacy. 
Privacy Introduction
As a security professional, it’s important to stay informed of the latest privacy laws that apply to your organization, especially if your organization handles customers’ personal data. Why is this so important? Ensuring your customer and employee data is protected is paramount to establishing and maintaining trust. In this module we’re going to review the tools for implementing an effective privacy program. 
If your organization stores and processes customer data, your customers trust you to protect, use, and process their data securely, in accordance with applicable laws. This data can include personal data such as contact, healthcare, or financial information, or business-related information such as expenditures, marketing, or analytics data. 
Regardless of what type of data you process or store, it’s important to keep it safe. In addition to processing or storing customer data, your organization is accountable for its own data, including knowledge about prospective customers, employee information, financial data, and more. 
So how do you ensure this data is protected? For starters, you should be aware of and follow applicable privacy laws. We get into the details of these privacy laws here. To document compliance with applicable privacy laws and protect yourself and your customers, it’s a good idea to have agreements in place when you’re collecting customer data. These agreements should detail how your organization will keep customer data secure and confidential. As an example, most international airlines are required to attest on their public websites to how they protect a customer’s privacy, what data they collect, and why and how it’s collected, used, assessed, safeguarded, and stored. 
Why Privacy Matters
Let’s step back for a moment and review the concept of privacy and what it means. Privacy relates to how a piece of information—or data— should be managed and protected based on its relative importance. 
Data privacy has become a hot topic lately due to lapses in security and concerns about how companies are using the customer data they collect. Data privacy concerns are particularly important for companies in certain sectors such as finance and healthcare. These sectors contain sensitive information and are typically highly regulated. They also are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks, which if successful may result in not only loss of this data, but also loss of confidence by consumers.  
Let’s look at an example. When you apply for a credit card, you’re typically required to provide your legal name, birthdate, address, government-issued identification number, and annual income. That’s a lot of information! Not only is this information used to verify your identity, but it also allows the credit card company to check your credit history. This information is considered your personal data, and the credit card company is required to put security measures in place to protect it. 
In this example, privacy means that the credit card company is responsible for protecting your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, that they’re transparent about how they use your personal data, that they use the data in accordance with applicable laws, and that you agree to the use of your data for a certain purpose. 
 
Privacy Terminology
Before we dive deeper into privacy laws, let’s review some basic definitions. 
Customer data: The information a customer provides while interacting with a business whether via a website, mobile application, social media, and more. 
Data subject: An individual whose personal data is collected, held, or processed. 
Personal data: The data that is directly attributable to a data subject and can identify an individual such as a name, home address, or personal identifier (for example, passport number). 
Sensitive personal data: Some types of personal data are considered sensitive and are subject to stricter regulation. This may include data about race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation. 
Processing: Any operation or set of operations on data (for example, access, collection, recording, retrieval, copying, storage, disclosure, dissemination, and so on). 
Controller: An individual or entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. 
Processor: An individual or entity that processes personal data on behalf of a controller. 
Custodian (or handler): The individual responsible for the safe custody, transport, and storage of the data, and implementation of business rules.  
Data Protection Authority (DPA): National authorities tasked with the protection of data and privacy as well as monitoring and enforcement of the data protection regulations within the Union. 
Your organization can act as both a processor and a controller, depending on the situation and the data involved. It’s helpful to think of the roles of processor and controller in relation to the allocation of responsibilities between parties. Your customers can be both controllers and processors. However, your organization always acts as a processor when a customer submits data to you and as controller when you determine the means and purposes of processing the data. 
Privacy Laws
Depending on where your organization operates, you may need to adhere to location-specific privacy laws. If your organization operates globally, it’s important to implement policy requirements applicable to the country of operation. For example, if your organization operates in Japan, you are subject to the Act on the Protection of Personal Information. 
Privacy laws exist to protect individuals with respect to their personal data. They also regulate how personal data can and cannot be used. Let’s take a closer look at what privacy laws address. 
•	Whether personal data can be collected and processed 
•	What and how information should be provided around data processing practices 
•	Who can access and use the personal data 
•	How personal data can be processed 
•	How the data should be secured 
•	When to delete or amend the data 
•	Who is allowed to transport or have custody of the data 
•	Where and how personal data can be transferred to other countries 
•	How security incidents are handled 
•	What rights data subjects have regarding their personal data 
Globally, there are two types of privacy laws: comprehensive (applicable to all industries and sectors) and sectoral (applicable to specific industries or sectors). In the US, the federal government has historically taken a sectoral approach. For example, there’s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is the US healthcare privacy law protecting data that reveals the health status of an individual (called protected health information or PHI).  
The only US national privacy law that exists is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which regulates how online companies can collect and use data on children under the age of 13.  
In the absence of a comprehensive national privacy law, several states have taken the initiative to  enact their own privacy legislation, including: 
•	California - California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) 
•	Virginia - Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA) 
•	Connecticut - Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA) 
•	Utah - Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) 
•	Colorado - Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) 
These states have either recently passed their own privacy legislation or are in the process of legislation. And many more states are considering doing the same. By passing their own privacy laws, these states provide their own protection for their constituents. 
In contrast, the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) take a more comprehensive approach through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is the EU’s and EEA’s privacy legislation and applies to all controllers and processors, irrespective of their industry or sector. However, there are also some sector-specific laws in Europe, such as for the telecoms sector. 
While not an exhaustive list, several other countries across the globe–including Japan, Australia, China, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, India, South Africa, and more–operate their own privacy laws, or are working on drafting them. Even though each country may have their own law, most privacy laws across the globe are based on the same core principles.

•	Data Privacy Impact Assessments 
We take a closer look at these principles in the next unit. 
Customer Contracts and Service Level Agreements
In addition to complying with privacy laws, organizations include privacy commitments in customer contracts or service level agreements (SLAs). These commitments detail ways your organization can use personal data, including those required by applicable law. 
International Privacy Certifications and Standards
In addition to privacy laws, your organization may also be required to comply with certain certifications and standards that impose comprehensive privacy requirements. These certifications and standards vary by industry, but may include: 
•	International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001/27018, which provide requirements for information security management systems and for protecting personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors 
•	Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, which help companies establish trust and confidence in their service delivery processes and controls 
•	TRUSTe certification, which enables organizations to demonstrate responsible practices consistent with standards for privacy accountability 
•	International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27701, which is an extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy information management. It provides guidelines for the processing of PII and helps organizations establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their Privacy Information Management System (PIMS). 
Privacy Policies
Your organization should abide by the commitments made to customers when you collect personal data from individuals. Also, your organization should maintain a privacy statement on your public website that describes the types of data you collect from users of your websites, and how you use and share that data. The commitments you make in that privacy statement should be similar to the ones you make in the contracts you sign with your customers. The same is true for internal privacy policies and employee notices that detail how you collect, use, share, and process employee data. 
Sum It Up
You now have a better understanding of privacy concepts, laws, and customer expectations. In the next unit, we cover privacy principles and how you can apply them to protect your organization.

Apply Data Privacy Principles 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	List 10 key privacy principles. 
•	Explain how the principles can be implemented in your organization. 
Privacy Principles
Now that you have a good understanding of data privacy basics, let’s dive into some principles and how they apply to your organization. Although legal requirements vary globally, there are some common principles that provide the foundation for many privacy laws. Let’s delve into these principles which we introduced in the previous unit. 
Fairness and Transparency 
Organizations should process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent way. 
Your organization may implement this principle by processing personal data in accordance with applicable laws and the privacy commitments or service level agreements (SLAs) made to your customers and end users. As aforementioned, it’s also a good idea to publish a privacy statement on your website detailing what personal data is collected in your capacity as a data controller and why, including information collected through cookies and analytics. In your privacy statement, it’s important to indicate the information types that you will not collect. Ultimately, no matter how you receive privacy data, you should obtain consent before processing it.  
Purpose Limitation 
Organizations should process personal data only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.  
At your organization, this means that anytime you collect personal data, you clearly communicate and are specific about how the data will be used. In most cases, if you want to use the data for something other than what was communicated, you must present a valid legal reason and seek permission before processing it. 
Data Minimization 
Organizations should only collect the minimum amount of data necessary for the processing purpose in question.  
Your organization shouldn’t collect personal data unless it’s necessary to perform your offered services. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data shall be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed,” while the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) calls this the “minimum necessary” rule. 
So, how does data minimization work? Let’s say you’re building an internal mobile app for your organization’s complimentary shuttle bus offered to employees. The data the app needs to collect and process includes employee personal data such as their home and office addresses, and other basic information (that is, name and phone number). However, the app doesn’t need an employee’s date of birth, ethnicity, or health or financial information. Since this additional information isn’t required, you shouldn’t collect it. 
Accuracy 
Personal data should be kept accurate and up to date. 
As a service provider to your customers, your organization needs to make sure your systems contain accurate records and reflect customer changes to data when they occur. Any data that’s considered inaccurate must have mechanisms to immediately erase or correct it. 
Data Deletion and Retention 
Organizations should only store personal data for as long as it’s required and for the originally intended purpose. 
Your organization shouldn’t keep data for an indefinite period even if it may be used in the future. Clear time frames should be established for when data is deleted with rationale for why the data is retained for that length of time. For example, you may need to retain security log files for certain periods of time to identify and track malicious adversary behaviors. However, the period still must remain finite, with supporting rationale. You should also be aware of data retention laws for specific types of data, such as legal documents, within the country where your organization provides that service. 
Security 
Organizations should use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized processing, accidental disclosure, loss, destruction, and alteration.  
Your organization needs to ensure that security systems adequately protect data. You can also help protect and secure the data you store through privacy enhancing techniques. Let’s discuss a few. 
•	Data segregation is the division of data into various data categories for the purposes of dividing or restricting access to different classes of data. Using this technique allows your organization to create separate access rules for datasets or different groups of users, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access. 
•	Encryption is a security method where information is scrambled into an unreadable format that can be accessed or decrypted only by a user with the correct key. Encryption protects the confidentiality of the data. 
•	Pseudonymization replaces the information that can identify a subject with pseudonyms or identifiers. It reduces the chance that personal data records and identifiers can identify an individual. 
•	Anonymization is the process of protecting private or sensitive information by erasing, obfuscating (masking), or encrypting it. It removes all identifiers associated with a person. 
Other security measures may exist at your organization to support data protection. It’s recommended that all employees with access to computing systems receive privacy training regardless of position, and read and acknowledge employee acceptable use policies. 
Accountability 
Your organization should create policies and implement processes that demonstrate you’re in compliance with privacy laws, regulations, and principles for data privacy. 
You should take measures to advance privacy through design and privacy by default. 
•	Privacy by design: Privacy by design occurs when an organization begins planning for a new or improved process, or activity, or when developing a new product, service, or feature. 
When your organization builds a new product, they should consider privacy policies and principles during the plan and design phase. It’s important to include all relevant stakeholders in this planning and design process, and legal teams, to make sure privacy is a priority and that your organization is abiding by the law. 
•	Privacy by default: Organizations should choose the most privacy-friendly default settings when collecting, processing, or storing personal data. For instance, if you were to sign up for an online social network account and plan to use one of its services, they may say they’re compliant with the privacy by default principle, requiring just your name and email address to function. However, if the social networking account immediately starts sharing your location or any other data outside of name and email address, they’re not adhering to the privacy by default principle. 
Individual Rights 
Privacy laws also detail a data subject’s rights to their personal data. These rights include: 
•	Data subject access request: Data subjects have the right to access a copy of any personal data a controller holds about them and receive confirmation that a controller is processing their personal data. They’re also entitled to details about the purposes of the processing, the categories being processed, how long the data is stored, and with whom the personal data has been shared. 
•	Right to object: Data subjects can, in certain cases, object to how their personal data is used. 
•	Data correction: Data subjects can request that their personal data is corrected or completed if it’s inaccurate or incomplete. 
•	Restriction: Data subjects can request that a company stop processing their personal data in limited circumstances. 
•	Right to deletion: Also known as “the right to be forgotten,” or under GDPR, the right to erasure, this empowers data subjects to request that a controller delete their personal data under certain conditions. Because the US is sectoral-based regarding privacy, most US privacy laws don’t have this right. One exception is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). 
•	Data portability: Where applicable to the type of processing, data subjects have the right to ask a controller to provide their personal data in an exportable format so they can transmit their data to another controller. 
Your organization’s obligation as a service provider is to assist your customers to manage these requests. As a controller, you’re responsible for complying with data subject requests, and the systems you use to manage personal data should accommodate such requests, including access, correction, deletion, and portability. 
International Transfers 
Certain countries and regions, such as the European Union (EU), restrict the transfer of personal data outside the country or region of origin unless the destination has implemented sufficient safeguards to guarantee the data is protected. If your organization operates internationally, you should implement measures that ensure you can legally transfer personal data across these boundaries. 
 
Data Protection Impact Assessment  
When your organization collects, stores, or uses personal data, the individuals whose data you’re processing are exposed to risks. These risks range from theft with the intent to impersonate an individual, to accidental disclosure. Within GDPR, your organization is required to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). According to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), a DPIA is designed to assess data likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of people, and to identify and minimize these risks as early as possible. Your organization may want to consider conducting a DPIA before launching data collection or processing activities that pose higher risks to data subjects.   
Sum It Up
You now have a better understanding of privacy principles and how to apply them to your organization. In the next unit, you learn about customer data and the role that data custodians play to protect it.

Get to Know Customer Data and Your Data Custodians 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Identify which information is considered customer data. 
•	Explain the difference between the two types of data custodians. 
•	Summarize what data custodians can and cannot do with data. 
Customer Data
The way we define customer data is that it’s the information submitted by or on behalf of a customer directly to one of your services. Customer data can take several forms and include the following. 
•	Personal data 
•	Contact information 
•	Account information 
•	Marketing data 
Personal Data 
Personal data involves both personally identifiable information (PII) and non-PII. PII is any information used to recognize or link an individual to an identity. It includes items such as first or last name, physical address, protected health information (PHI), location, age, and more. Non-PII is anonymous information that can potentially identify more than one person (IP addresses, device identification, web cookies, and more). 
Contact Information 
Contact information provides the means to communicate with a person, such as a personal or business phone number or email address. 
Account Information 
Account information holds critical data about a customer’s user account, including name, order, billing, interaction, and credit information. 
Marketing Data 
Marketing data is any information that is of benefit to marketing teams, such as competitive intelligence, market research, commercial transactions, customer feedback, preferences and interests, and other metrics. 
 
You should define customer data in your service level agreements (SLAs) to stay in sync with your customers on what is considered customer data and what rules apply to it. 
What Is Not Customer Data
Not all data your customers provide to you is considered customer data. For example, information your customers share with you via any means outside of your offered services is not customer data. This may include information your customer shares with you before they sign up for your services, or information you obtain from publicly available sources or third-party content providers.  
Types of Data Custodians
Now that you have a solid understanding of privacy laws, customer commitments, privacy principles, and what’s considered customer data, let’s introduce you to data custodians and discuss how they fit into the picture. 
There are likely two types of data custodians at your organization: personal and customer. 
Personal data custodians are those who access and handle personal data. Some examples of personal data custodians are: 
•	Salespeople who have access to customers’ and prospective customers’ personal data. 
•	Marketing personnel who manage email and digital marketing to individuals. 
•	Human resources, IT, payroll, security, managers, and other personnel who have access to employee data. 
Customer data custodians access and handle customer data (which can include personal data). These custodians are generally a selected group of employees within your organization who have access to customer data. Typically, customer data custodians fall under technical support operations or customer support. 
While there are some requirements that apply to both personal data custodians and customer data custodians, there are typically additional requirements that apply only to customer data custodians. That’s because customer data is subject to your customer contracts and SLAs, which may go beyond what privacy laws require. Let’s look at some baseline requirements for data custodians. 
Data Custodian Responsibilities 
•	Implement technical controls for safeguarding data confidentiality. 
•	Limit, authorize, and control access to personal and customer data. 
•	Maintain technical processes to sustain data integrity. 
•	Validate that data added to datasets are consistent with a common data model. 
•	Process, access, handle, or view personal or customer data as necessary to perform their duties. 
•	Adhere to policies on internal and external data sharing. 
If you’re unsure about sharing personal data outside of your organization, contact your legal department for assistance.

Report Data Privacy Security Incidents 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Explain what constitutes a data privacy security incident. 
•	Identify potential data privacy security incidents. 
•	Know what to do when you suspect or know a data privacy security incident has happened. 
What Is a Security Incident?
Many authorities around the world have adopted security incident notification laws, from the European Union (EU) to countries in Latin America (LATAM) to Japan and Asia-Pacific (JAPAC) regions to every United States (US) state and territory. Recently in the US, the president signed into law the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022, which requires critical infrastructure companies to report significant cybersecurity incidents and all ransom payments to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). 
Depending on the country your organization operates out of, there are numerous incident reporting laws and regulations for specific industries such as government, healthcare, energy, telecoms, and financial services providers, with each adopting their own definition of what constitutes a security incident (or data breach). Depending on the security incident notification laws that impact your organization, your customer service level agreements (SLAs) or contracts should contain security incident notification requirements that apply to customer data. 
A data privacy security incident is any unauthorized use of personal data or customer data, whether accidental or intended. Consider these examples of common security incidents. 
•	A sales representative sends an email with customer data to the wrong customer. 
•	A manager prints a resume of a candidate, but on his way home, he leaves the document on the train. 
•	A former employee who has left the company still has access to your organization’s systems and accesses customer records. 
•	An intern opens an email attachment containing malware, which results in deleted or encrypted customer contact information. 
•	A shared drive is overly permissioned, granting too many people access to personal data. 
•	A customer’s credentials or secret keys are exposed on a public GitHub repository. 
•	An employee’s work device (for example, a laptop or smartphone) is lost or stolen. 
•	An employee accidentally discloses personal data in a response to an email that turns out to be part of a phishing attack. 
All these incidents qualify as potential security incidents and should be reported to your organization’s security team. 
Reporting a Security Incident
If you suspect a potential data privacy incident, report it immediately, even if you’re not 100% sure the incident qualifies as a data breach or security incident. If your organization has an annual security awareness training program in place, make sure to review it for up-to-date information regarding how to report suspicious activity or suspected security incidents at your organization. 
When reporting an incident, you should provide as much information as possible, including: 
•	What happened 
•	Who the individuals or groups involved were 
•	The time, date, and time zone of when the incident occurred 
•	Which services were involved or potentially impacted 
•	Point of contact for follow-up questions 
Security Incident Reporting Timelines
Your organization may have a legal obligation to report data privacy incidents within a short time frame to regulators, customers, and affected individuals. You have an obligation to report security incidents immediately to your internal security team, to allow them time to investigate the incident and meet external reporting requirements. In some cases, failure to notify applicable parties of a data privacy incident within the required time frames can lead to substantial fines, a potential breach of your contractual obligations, damage to customer trust, and tarnishing of your organization’s reputation. 
As you can see, it’s critical to report all potential security incidents right away, even if you made the mistake that led to the exposure of personal or customer data. 
 
Sum It Up
In this module, you’ve been introduced to data privacy laws and principles. You’ve also learned how to identify customer data and who is allowed to handle that data. Lastly, you’ve been introduced to reporting requirements of data privacy incidents.

Get to Know the Public Sector 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Define the public sector.
•	Describe the types of work performed in the public sector.
•	List the reasons public sector employees are potential cybersecurity targets.
•	Explain the importance of meeting compliance standards.
•	List the risks resulting in the misuse of public sector data.
Before You Start 
If you completed the Get Started with Cloud Security Engineering trail then you already know about cloud computing and how to design secure cloud solutions. Now, let’s talk about how to improve the security of public sector data in the cloud.
Overview of the Public Sector 
The public sector consists of national, state, and local governments. These entities provide critical infrastructure like roads, bridges, and water. They operate public transportation. They administer elections. They even strengthen national defense and secure national security systems. In recent years, many public sector organizations have adopted digital technology to provide better service and more transparency for their citizens. However, this broad array of service offerings makes these public sector entities attractive to a variety of cybersecurity threat actors.
 
To improve speed, scale, and cost of these digital technologies, many public sector organizations are migrating and modernizing some or all public services using cloud-based offerings. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources—for example, networks, servers, storage, applications (apps), and services—that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. 
Cloud computing provides public sector organizations the flexibility and scalability to meet modern technology demands. These organizations may use their own cloud for internal resources. Or they can use the secure cloud services of a private company—also known as a cloud service provider (CSP)—approved specifically for public sector organizations. They can even use a distributed hybrid deployment model that employs a mix of public sector infrastructure and private cloud services. 
The shift to cloud computing has helped improve cybersecurity by taking advantage of the security expertise offered by CSPs. But it isn't without risk. Mapping out those risks and their impacts is critical to assuring the cloud and the data residing in it remains secure.
Cloud Security
Cloud security consists of a set of policies, controls, procedures, and technologies that work together to protect cloud-based systems, data, and infrastructure. These security measures are configured to protect cloud data, support regulatory compliance, and safeguard customers’ privacy.
Cloud security responsibilities are shared between public sector organizations and CSPs in contrast to a public sector-owned and managed data center. Depending on the cloud configuration and licensing agreement, public sector users may have more or less control over how shared resources and data are accessed. It’s important to note that moving to the cloud does not transfer security responsibility to the CSP. While the CSP may operate certain security controls on the public sector organizaton’s behalf, the public sector customer is ultimately responsible for validating that they do so effectively.
Cloud Service Models
NIST defines the following cloud service models in order of level of management provided by CSP vendors.
•	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Vendors provide the basic infrastructure and hardware.
•	Platform as a Service (PaaS): Vendors provide a managed environment for a customer’s app.
•	Software as a Service (SaaS): Vendors provide a fully managed app, and customers need only supply their data.
When customer data is processed, stored, or transmitted off-premise and under the control of a third party, such as a CSP, the ability of the data owner to implement security controls is often limited. In cloud computing environments, the implementation of controls is largely dependent upon the type of service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), the type of cloud deployment model (private, public, hybrid, multi-cloud), the type of controls (physical versus logical), and the specifications of responsibility delineated in the contract between the public sector organization and the CSP.
It’s critical that public sector customers choose services accordingly and understand the risks and limitations of third-party control. Public sector organizations can outsource the functionality of a role, such as storage management, but must still verify security requirements like encryption are implemented. Whether you’re a private CSP employee or a public sector employee, if you have access to public sector cloud services, you have privileged access to critical infrastructure, networks, and data. Let’s dig a bit deeper into what makes public sector cloud security concerns unique. 
Public Sector Data Security Requirements 
Public sector cloud services have unique security compliance requirements. Data stored in a public sector cloud platform must be adequately maintained and secured to meet these special compliance requirements. As more organizations adopt the cloud, public sector organizations have created a number of security aids, standards, and regulations to safeguard those transitions. The table lists some regulations and standards that outline public sector data security requirements in the US.  
Regulation/Standard	Description
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014
Strengthens information security within US federal agencies by requiring them to implement information security programs to ensure their systems’ confidentiality, integrity, and availability
NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
Provides a framework for federal agencies, contractors, and other sources that use or operate a federal information system to develop and implement a risk-based approach to manage information security risk
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS PUB 199)
Outlines impact levels of data, which are are a way of categorizing the sensitivity of data and what controls are necessary to secure data of varying sensitivity levels
NIST 800-53
Defines security controls for information systems (including cloud systems) containing public sector data, including access control, media protection, and physical and environmental protections
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
Defines security baselines for cloud services based upon the NIST 800-53 controls
Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide
Builds upon FedRAMP to tailor control baselines for DoD mission owners by providing a knowledge base for cloud computing security authorization processes and security requirements 
Here are some examples of security compliance requirements for public sector cloud services in other countries.
•	India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) provides requirements and guidelines for CSPs to register their services with the Indian government to be considered eligible to work with public sector entities in India.
•	The Japanese government has a system called the Information System Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP) for assessing the security of CSPs to participate in public sector projects.
•	The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has an Information Security Registered Assessor’s Program (IRAP) framework, which assesses the implementation and effectiveness of an organization’s security controls against the Australian government’s security requirements.
Discover more comprehensive compliance certifications and attestations. No matter the country, cloud security compliance requirements put in place data location constraints, requirements for identity management, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), and more. 
Threat Actor Targets and Meeting Compliance Standards 
Whether you’re a private CSP employee or a public sector employee with access to critical security systems, infrastructure, networks, and accounts, you’re a primary target for cybercriminals and foreign intelligence organizations. Combating all such threats is critical to national security and a well-functioning civil society. As a critical part of an organization’s defenses, you play an important role in protecting privacy and security.
As someone with access to public sector data, you need to be aware of, understand, and follow the increased security, privacy, and compliance measures that platforms containing this data require, and what threats to public sector cloud services may look like. This requires validating on an ongoing basis that the security controls you’ve selected are actually implemented and functioning properly. Luckily, CSPs provide a range of features and services that public sector customers can use to build cloud solutions to meet their security needs.
Risks of Misuse of Public Sector Data
There are varying levels of risk to public sector data if the CIA of the data is compromised. Depending on the type of information breached, a victim can suffer social, economic, or physical harm. If an identity thief gets hold of the compromised information, the victim may face financial loss, damaged credit, compromised medical records, threats, or harassment.
If public sector data is misused, your organization can also suffer financially. If the root cause of data loss is due to your organization not adhering to laws and regulations, your organization or its staff can be subject to criminal or civil penalties, or incur additional costs associated with responding and recovering from the incident, including having to fund credit monitoring for your customers.
Your organization can also be required to receive close scrutiny from regulators. In the end, organizations can put their public reputation at risk and shatter public confidence if they don’t protect public sector data. As someone with access to public sector data, it’s your responsibility to review and assess the risks associated with misuse of public sector data, and do your part to minimize them.
Sum It Up 
Now that you understand more about the public sector and why users dealing with public sector data are potential cybersecurity targets, let’s take a look at one specific type of threat to public sector data security: insider threat.

Identify Insider Threats to Public Sector Data 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Explain the concept of insider threat.
•	Define insiders and insider threat categories.
•	Identify ways insider threats can happen at your organization.
•	Explain ways you can defend yourself from insider threat.
•	Identify insider threat and security reporting recommendations.
What Is Insider Threat? 
An insider is any individual who has access to your organization’s facilities, systems, technology, customer data, or staff. Insiders can include public sector employees, former employees, contractors, subcontractors, and even customers. As more information is stored in the cloud, staff with access to these systems could potentially threaten your organization.
Cybersecurity measures are frequently focused on threats from outside an organization rather than from individuals inside an organization. However, insider threats are the source of many security incidents across industries. They can potentially steal sensitive data, perform malicious attacks on your networks, and damage or destroy systems and services. 
There are generally two categories of insider threat: accidental and intentional. Some behaviors that lead to unintentional threats include:
•	Using unauthorized removable media
•	Using personal email for work activities
•	Falling for phishing emails
•	Using unauthorized applications (apps) and software
•	Failing to fully test changes to systems before pushing them to widespread use
On the flip side, intentional insiders use their access deliberately to cause malicious harm. For example, they may steal confidential information about public sector services for personal or financial gain, or damage systems or destroy data in retribution for a missed promotion, involuntary termination, or other grievance. 
Challenges to Detecting Insider Threats 
Malicious acts by insiders are seldom impulsive. Usually, stressful events happen over time that result in the transition of a trusted insider to a malicious one. If not identified and resolved in a healthy manner, these stressors could contribute to an individual’s intent to cause harm to your organization and its staff. That’s why it’s important to identify and resolve potential stressors early on. Additionally, external factors can be at play. An insider could be targeted by an external organization and bribed, or could be extorted.
Insider threat actors can be difficult to detect and often go unnoticed. As someone who deals with public sector data in the cloud, you serve as the eyes and ears of the organization, and need to pay attention to indicators of insider risk.
What Are Risk Indicators? 
There are two types of risk indicators: direct and indirect. Direct risk indicators include the following types of behavior.
•	Occasional display of suspicious or disruptive behavior
•	Attempts to gain access to information or data that’s outside the scope of an employee’s job responsibilities, including attempts to recruit or coerce others into giving information or doing something suspicious
•	Bullying or sexual harassment of fellow employees
•	Workplace violence incidents
•	Serious violations of organization cloud policies
•	Disregard of security procedures and protocols
•	Financial changes including unexplained affluence or excessive debt
•	Working or show up for work under the influence
•	Physical and logical access to facilities or proprietary information outside of normal work hours
Indirect risk indicators are behaviors that require additional analysis to reveal suspicious motives. They can include the following.
•	Visible animosity toward a coworker
•	Sudden decline in work performance
•	Irresponsible use of social media
Defend Against Insider Threats 
Measures to defend against insider threats include documenting expectations in security agreements, monitoring, cooperating with Human Resources (HR), implementing data protections, and reporting in a timely manner. Let’s take a closer look.
Security Agreements
To help protect against insider threats, public sector employees should define explicit security agreements for any cloud services, especially regarding access restrictions and monitoring capabilities. Public sector data hosted in a private sector cloud service provider (CSP) is under the care of a third party. Malicious insiders who work for the CSP might be able to access the data stored in the cloud for multiple public sector organizations.
One tool to consider in strengthening the security of cloud systems containing public sector data is to put in place terms and conditions to document trust relationships between organizations owning, operating, or maintaining the information systems. For example, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) moderate baseline recommends this control. These agreements can help document expectations around access to the information system, and how information is processed, stored, or transmitted. Whether this step is necessary depends on the compliance regimes applicable to the organization, and what existing sharing and trust agreements exist between the organizations.
Security Assessments
Another tool for defending against insider threat and bolstering the security of cloud systems containing public sector data is to develop a security assessment plan. For example, the FedRAMP moderate baseline recommends agencies to assess security controls on both an initial and ongoing basis, continuously monitor their IT systems, and ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures, among other security practices.
Monitoring
Whether you work at a public sector organization, a CSP, or a third-party vendor, if you process and store public sector data in the cloud, you have a responsibility to monitor that data. Security monitoring in the cloud includes capturing, reviewing, and correlating audit log data. Also consider logging and reviewing all activities performed by users within cloud environments. Check for events such as abnormal login times or attempts to access unauthorized resources.
Organizations dealing with public sector data can consider using user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) solutions that use algorithms and machine learning to detect anomalies in the behavior of not only the users in a corporate network but also the routers, servers, and endpoints in that network. UEBA can help you to recognize any peculiar or suspicious behavior, such as instances where there are irregularities from normal everyday patterns or usage. For example, if a network user regularly downloads files of 20 megabytes every day but starts downloading 40 gigabytes of files, the UEBA system considers this an anomaly and alerts an information technology (IT) admin. Or if automations are in place, it automatically disconnects that user from the network.
Integrate with Human Resources
Another important measure is integrating insider threat defenses with Human Resources (HR). HR professionals are more likely to identify patterns, behavior, and trends that help mitigate potential harm to an organization and its employees. For example, HR can identify red flags during the interview process, creating mechanisms for employees and managers to provide two-way feedback and share concerns. HR can also provide suggestions for delivering notifications of termination respectfully and in a way that minimizes intrusiveness and embarrassment. Depending upon an employee’s role, there may also be separation agreements that are required to continue confidentiality post-employment.
HR also has insights to employee performance records and potential disciplinary actions for correlating events back to certain behaviors. It’s critical that HR perform pre-hire background checks that are regularly updated after hire, obtain employee acknowledgement of policies and practices, and provide training on insider threats.
Data Protections
Additionally, it’s important that public sector organizations ensure that their data protection and monitoring requirements for CSPs are commensurate with the organization’s own requirements. It’s vital that protections include physical and technological requirements, and HR requirements for CSP employees.
Timely Reporting
As someone who works with public sector data, you can serve as the first line of defense for insider threats by reporting unusual activity to your organization’s security team. Your organization’s incident response team can investigate unauthorized access to data or attempts to circumvent security configurations by keeping an eye on suspicious activities or threat indicators. Depending on your organization’s requirements, you may also need to report unusual activity to your human resources team, or outside groups such as law enforcement.

If something at work doesn’t feel right—an unusual access request or information request, for example—don’t hesitate to contact your organization’s incident response or security team right away. Keep in mind that the longer an attacker is on your network, the deeper they can go, the more backdoors they can open, and the more data they may be able to extract. Any public sector data displayed outside the cloud’s authorized boundaries constitutes a security incident and should be reported immediately. This applies not only to customer data but also to any information that can impact the CIA of the cloud environment.
Acting fast when you spot a potential security incident is critical, because it helps your incident response team track down the source and thwart any potential damage. What’s more, if your organization has a security incident involving public sector data, you may be subject to external reporting requirements. For example, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), organizations have just 72 hours to gather all related information and report data breaches to the relevant regulator.
By reporting suspected incidents to your organization’s incident response team immediately, your organization is better able to meet its external reporting requirements. If your organization fails to meet these requirements, you can incur fines, damage customer and investor trust, and continue to repeat past mistakes.
Sum It Up 
In this unit, you learned about insider threats and the concern they pose for protecting public sector data in the cloud. Now, let’s turn our attention to an important security control to consider when managing and protecting public sector data in the cloud: access control.

Secure Public Sector Data 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe how to safeguard high value assets in the cloud.
•	Explain how to securely handle public sector data in the cloud.
•	Identify media protections for public sector data in the cloud.
•	List best practices for data backup and storage in the cloud.
Now that we’ve talked about access control and encryption, let’s continue by discussing data handling controls for protecting public sector data in the cloud.
High-Value Assets 
High-value assets (HVAs)—that sounds important, doesn’t it? That’s because it is! An HVA is information or an information system that is so critical to an organization that the loss or corruption of this information or loss of access to the system results in a serious impact on the organization’s ability to perform its mission or conduct business. It’s no surprise then that it’s essential to have special controls in place to protect these types of assets, especially when hosted in the cloud. These controls should be outlined in your organization’s data classification standard. The last thing you want is for a cybercriminal to gain unauthorized access to high value asset data, including public sector information!
To identify and protect high-value assets, start with a business impact analysis (BIA), which predicts the consequences of disruption of a business function and gathers information needed to develop recovery strategies. During the BIA, identify potential loss scenarios and associated costs from a compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of mission critical data. Also identify recommendations for recovery. Depending upon the data contained in the HVA, it may be necessary to conduct other reviews, such as a Privacy Impact Assessment.
Because of the importance of safeguarding HVAs, only allow as small as necessary a subset of your organization’s employees access to them. Have policies and procedures in place for managing HVAs, and cover protections while the data is stored in your systems and when it’s shared externally.
Secure Data Handling 
To make sure you handle public sector data in a way that complies with your organization’s requirements, always keep sensitive data in controlled, approved, and secure cloud environments with backup capabilities. Production servers provide greater security than your laptop, for example. Here are some additional steps you can take to keep public sector data secure.
•	Avoid accessing public sector data unless it’s required for your job.
•	Only access the data from an authorized or approved device issued by your organization.
•	Avoid downloading data to your computer, unless required for your job.
•	Do not export any information from a cloud environment whose disclosure can impact the CIA of the environment.
•	Do not use an external email account to send information.
•	Use only approved third-party storage sites.
•	Limit printing of data to only what’s necessary for your job, and keep your desk clean of sensitive data when stepping away or leaving for the day.
•	Encrypt and back up data to mitigate risk if data is lost or stolen.
•	Do not store information on Universal Serial Buses (USBs) or external hard drives.
You may be wondering what type of information disclosure can impact the CIA of your environment. This can include, for example, if a medical provider at the Department of Veterans Affairs exports patient data from the cloud system hosting that data, and emails it to the wrong patient. In determining potential impact, it’s key you consider the quantity of sensitive data. For example, breaches of 25 records of personally identifiable information (PII) and 25 million records may have different impacts. 
Also evaluate the sensitivity of the data fields when combined. Aggregating different data sets can increase the potential impact to the information if disclosed improperly. For this reason, it’s best to de-identify information where possible by removing account numbers, names, and other identifiable information when aggregating information. 
 
Media Protection 
Whether at a cloud service provider (CSP) or a public sector organization, a limited number of employees need access to media that contains public sector data. It’s imperative that your organization maintains a media protection policy that describes how to properly handle backup tapes and other digital media like portable hard drives and USBs. In the policy, address media marking, storage, transport, sanitization, disposal, and use. If you’re in a position with access to media containing public sector data, it’s critical to review your organization’s policies and familiarize yourself with these processes.
Data Backup and Storage
In addition to identifying your mission critical data, it’s crucial that your organization backs up this data to maintain accessibility to pertinent information. Per your organization’s information security standards, back up public sector data in the cloud at a frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives. Define these objectives in your BIA. Define specific guidelines pertaining to these objectives by the regulations and standards applicable to your organization’s jurisdiction.
•	The recovery time objective (RTO) documents the amount of time an organization has to restore its processes to an acceptable service level after a disruption to avoid intolerable consequences associated with the disruption.
•	The recovery point objective (RPO) documents how fresh the recovered data must be.
Protect backup information and media at all storage locations, whether in the cloud or at an off-site storage facility. Sanitize, destroy, or both, data that’s no longer required in line with your organization’s data retention policy or standard. Define specific guidelines pertaining to data sanitization by the regulations and standards applicable to your organization's jurisdiction. Consider using a combination of online and offline backups for further recovery options.
The Bottom Line 
You are the strongest link in your organization’s security efforts. You now have the knowledge to protect and safeguard your organization and customers. As someone who deals with public sector data in the cloud, you’re entrusted with very sensitive data. It’s up to you to be compliant and vigilant in your efforts to stay secure. Don’t forget, if you see something, say something by contacting your organization’s security team. Interested in learning more about cybersecurity careers and technologies?

Identify Secrets 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Identify three types of secrets at your organization. 
•	Define authentication, authorization, and encryption. 
•	Explain strong key management principles. 
What Is a Secret?
Customer trust issues can derail even the best-laid cybersecurity plans. Your customers rely on you to safeguard their data, and to keep that data safe from anyone who does not have a business need to access it, even someone inside your organization’s network. While protections like network segmentation protect data, code, and applications from external and internal threats, it’s still up to you to manage secret information carefully.  
So, just what is a secret? You can define secrets in three main ways.  
1.	Credentials that authenticate individual identities for systems and services 
2.	Private keys used to sign certificates that authorize services to other services 
3.	Keys used to encrypt other secret information like customer data 
If you start with these definitions, you can sort your secrets into categories. The first category is passwords, or other credentials that you use to protect your laptop, phone, and organizational access. The second category is the private keys that services use to provide access to sensitive systems, services, and information. And the third category is the keys used to encrypt content like customer and organizational data, so that even if it is accessed, it is kept secret.  
Password Versus Key 
For most computer security purposes and for most users, a key is not the same thing as a password, although a password can be used as a key. The primary difference between keys and passwords is that passwords are intended to be generated, read, remembered, and reproduced by a human user.  
A key, by contrast, is intended for use by the software that is implementing the cryptographic algorithm, so human readability is not required. In fact, most users are, in most cases, unaware of the existence of the keys being used on their behalf by the security components of their everyday software applications. 
Secrets are never as simple as they seem, and handling secrets well involves several tricky factors. When managing secrets, here are some good questions to ask. 
How secret is this secret? How many humans know it? How many places is it stored? How hard would it be for an attacker to learn or guess it? Good secrets should be very hard to guess and obtain if you’re not supposed to have them. 
Will this secret always be available when needed? Let’s say your service needs a secret to do its job. If the service storing that secret goes down, your customers are going to have a rough day without access to the system they need. The availability of secrets depends on the availability of your service overall. 
As your organization continues to innovate with new technologies, effective secret management becomes even more important. 
Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption
There are three main ways to protect secrets: authentication, authorization, and encryption. They are all related, and they often overlap with one another. Sometimes they are used in combination, such as when a system authenticates your identity and then checks whether you’re authorized to access that system. At other times, systems encrypt secrets so that they cannot be understood without being decrypted.   
Authentication 
Authentication is the process of proving your identity. Let’s say you are trying to log in to your company’s website as yourself. The website asks you to enter your password so it knows it’s you. Authentication assures you that a call is actually coming from a service you trust and not from an attacker.  
Authentication can be single-factor or multi-factor (MFA). A factor is what you use to authenticate, and it falls into one of three categories. 
1.	Something you have: Examples include a proximity key like a wireless key fob, or a magnetic strip card like your personal debit card 
2.	Something you are: Examples include a fingerprint or facial identification 
3.	Something you know: Examples include a password, passphrase, or personal identification number (PIN) 
Single-factor authentication is when you use just one of these factors to authenticate, such as when you type in your username and password (something you know) to log in to your email. MFA requires two or more of these items, like when you use your credit card (something you have) and enter your PIN (something you know) to complete a transaction.  
Authorization  
Authorization is the next step after authentication. Now that you have verified your identity, what are you allowed to do? One user shouldn’t be authorized to change another user’s password, for example. 
Another example of authorization, are the resources you have access to for your job. If you work on the Finance team, you shouldn’t be able to access a Human Resources database, and vice versa. You only see the resources that you are authorized to use.  
For high-security processes, you may need to demonstrate that you’re authorized by more than one group in order to gain access. This is known as quorum authorization. For example, if you’re an auditor and need temporary access to a secure financial system, you may require approval from both the business owner of the system and a senior administrator. This method prevents any one group from providing access to secure systems without sufficient authorization. 
Encryption  
Encryption uses mathematical equations to scramble data so that they appear to be random. Only parties with the right secret key can decrypt the contents. Even if attackers can intercept the data your service sends or stores, encryption prevents them from understanding the true contents of the data without the secret key. 
All of these techniques require secrets, and they require those secrets to be stored securely. If an attacker knows the password or the decryption key, it doesn’t matter how sophisticated your authentication or encryption schemes are.  
Let’s take a look at some best practices for managing these keys.  
Manage Your Encryption Keys
Just as there are questions you should ask yourself about secrets management, there are also factors to consider when you manage keys.  
Make It Durable 
If you permanently lose a key used to encrypt data, you’ve effectively lost the data no matter how many backups you have of the encrypted bits. This situation can be especially challenging with secrets, because the usual response (make lots of backup copies!) conflicts with the first principle of secrets management, which is to keep the secret secret. You can make your keys more durable by backing them up and storing them in an additional secure location to ensure that you still have access to the keys in case one location is destroyed in a disaster. This can be performed by using the native backup options provided by your application or by using a dedicated encryption key backup system. 
Change It 
It’s best to use an automated process to change keys regularly. Doing so allows you to test your key management process of changing secrets to prevent unauthorized access. It also allows you to take action if an attacker is able to steal a secret. By changing the key, the attacker might have the data, but they would be unable to unlock it, rendering it useless.  
Declare Cryptoperiods 
A cryptoperiod is the lifetime of a key. When you generate a key, you should declare a cryptoperiod. It’s then tracked throughout the usage of the key. For some scenarios, like transport layer security (TLS) certificates used for secure web communication, the protocol directly supports this concept, and using it as designed automatically sets a cryptoperiod expiration limit. The cryptoperiod for TLS is designated by the notBefore and notAfter fields specifying the validity period. 
When a cryptoperiod expires, copies of the key material are destroyed or rendered useless, and this process is logged. In the case of data encrypted at rest, take care to ensure the data is reencrypted with an active key or keys prior to discarding the key material. Also, once key material has reached the end of its lifetime, do not reuse it for other purposes. Be sure to generate new keys for any needs beyond the expiration date.

Today’s customers are digital and on the move. They connect to each other instantly through multiple channels, and they expect the same from the companies they deal with. Let’s look at how Service Cloud can help your call center team exceed your customers’ ever-demanding expectations.
According to top researcher Forrester, “The ability to align products, operations, and business models to what we call a ‘customer-obsessed operating model’ will determine a company's ultimate success.” In other words, for businesses to keep customers happy and to stay competitive, you must invest in sophisticated technology that lets your contact center deliver top-notch service on every channel.
Change Channels—and Customer Interactions 
The way in which customers contact you is always shifting: calling, emailing, texting, and so on. The shift will continue as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more commonplace. Brace yourself for AI to disrupt customer support jobs, as nonhuman interactions are on the rise. For example, with the Internet of Things (IOT), a washing machine can predict the need to purchase more detergent and instantly connect with a retailer’s app (such as Amazon Alexa) to place and confirm the order. This is not to say we don’t need service agents, but the way they interact with customers is changing fast. Human interaction will still be required on many of the customer service cases coming through your organization. But as new technology makes contacting service easier, more accessible, and instant, the overall volume of customer service interactions through multiple channels will continue to climb.
So What’s Next? 
Agents must become experts in all customer engagement channels to make their customer interactions more personalized and, well, human. But what happens if your agents don’t have the right tools to meet the shifting demands of customers? Customer frustration can increase as brand loyalty decreases, ultimately leading to lower CSAT and NPS scores...and greater attrition.
That’s why leading organizations understand the need for an intelligent, flexible customer service platform that can give their agents the tools to make their jobs easier, and meet the higher demands of today’s customers. And it’s why organizations are digitally transforming their customer contact centers with the Service Cloud platform.
The Service Cloud Advantage: Connect with Connected Customers 
It’s not necessary to make things overcomplicated to offer an omnichannel experience. You can make it happen in a single platform.
Here’s how: Service Cloud gives your agents the power to deliver service that bridges the gap from a transaction to an interaction. It’s as instant and easy as a conversation, on whatever channel your customers are using—from a single platform. Now your agents can respond in real-time to any customer, anywhere.
•	Phone
•	Text/SMS
•	Email
•	Websites
•	Chat
•	Mobile apps
•	Social Media
•	Self-service site
•	Two-way video chat	 
Give Agents a Single, 360-Degree Customer View 

Imagine this: Every single service agent can turn to their desktop and have a real-time view of a customer's entire journey with your company. And they can then use that information to offer personalized service—fast.
The  Lightning Service Console is designed with agents in mind. And since the console is built on the Salesforce platform, your agents can access information from different systems across the company. This enables agents to access everything they need to provide quality customer service from one screen.
Boost Agent Productivity—and Customer Happiness 

It’s not unusual for companies to have 10 or 20 systems that agents use to find all a customer’s information. If agents have all of that information on one screen, they can solve customers’ issues much faster, and work more efficiently. And you can boost customer satisfaction and your ROI. With the Lightning Service Console, everything an agent needs is right at their fingertips so that they can deliver:
•	Faster service: Rapidly work through any backlog of cases with tools that eliminate clicks and let agents take care of customers quickly, increase customer satisfaction levels, and stay motivated by feeling agile and productive.
•	Smarter service : Agents can be proactive service gurus, address inefficiencies before they happen, and feel empowered with the right information to make more informed decisions that help build lasting customer relationships.
•	Personalized service : “ 68% of consumers say it’s very important for service agents to know their full history.” Regardless of channel, your agents can always know everything about your customer. Whether it’s past issues, purchase history, or data from a backend system, everything’s all in one place.
So get ready to leapfrog the competition as you deliver on the personalized experiences your customer cares about most.
Help Customers Help Themselves with Self-Service Sites 
Did you know that most customers prefer not to talk to a live agent? In fact, “81% of them try self-service first.” So how can you offer personalized self-service on any channel a customer chooses?
With Service Cloud, you can create a single, branded Experience Cloud site that your customers can access to find what they need, on any device, anywhere they go. This frees agents to spend more time working on the toughest cases.
So what about those questions going unanswered in self-service sites?
Salesforce Experience Cloud sites integrate with Service Cloud. Customers can create cases manually, agents can escalate customer questions to cases, and managers can set workflows to escalate cases if a question hasn't been answered
Meet Rising Customer Expectations on Every Channel 
Everyone appreciates a genuine conversation. That goes for customers, too. It’s time for service agents to ditch the call script and engage with customers with more personalized conversations.
Research shows that the “service customers experience from your center influences the level of service they expect to experience in their next contact.” It’s important to understand what customers expect from your organization, so you can reposition the contact center to meet shifting expectations quickly and efficiently. Let’s look at how to do that.
Best Practices for Omnichannel Call Center Success
1. Customer service is a team sport:
•	Ensure that everyone in your service organization, from agents to your management team, thoroughly understands your top 10 basic customer expectations.
•	Be sure to post them prominently.
 Service Team Tip 
Have your service center management memorize the list of top 10
customer expectations, and make a habit of considering them when
making decisions.

2. Don’t guess what customers want. Go straight to the source: the customer.
•	Create services based on what customers really expect.
•	Then listen to customer interactions with agents and social channels. Take frequent and detailed surveys to get insight on how you’re meeting the team’s 10 expectations.
 Service Team Tip 
Consider posting a scorecard based on customer feedback to keep
managers and agents up to date on changing customer expectations.

3. Exceed expectations.
•	Steve Jobs said, “Customers don’t usually know what they want until you show it to them.” Go beyond the status quo and give customers more than what they ask for, and differentiate your brand through service.
•	Transform your call center now to get a jump-start on the future.
 Management Tip
Read the Trailhead module about Service Analytics and Discovery Einstein 
to learn how Salesforce can help predict what a customer needs before
they ask for it.
4. Build cross-functional teams.
•	Make customer service a team sport by serving customers across your organization.
•	Use your company’s combined information, support, processes, products, and services to meet and exceed customer expectations.
 Management Tip
Use Salesforce Experience Cloud sites within your own organization to keep
everyone connected and engaged across divisions. This better supports
your service organization.
5. Let your customers guide your strategy.
•	Ensure that the evolving customer expectations are central to how you approach your customer relationships.
•	Enable your customers to drive everything, including segmentation, the channels you make available, service-level objectives, your hours of operation, and more.
 
Management Tip
Consider adding customer surveys that include capturing their operational
preferences alongside service-level expectations.

Now you have a few new service strategies to give your customers simplified, fast, convenient, and consistent services, that can build loyalty and turn them into your brand ambassador.

Hire and Coach for Success 
Learning Objectives

•	Explain how to hire the right service agents.
•	Explain how to motivate, train, and boost agent morale.
•	List what to look for when assessing agent performance and how to give effective feedback.
Turn Customer Service Agents into Agents of Change 
Turnover statistics at most call centers reveal a truly scary picture, with plenty of effort and training dollars wasted, as experienced agents jump ship for better opportunities. Want to figure out how to stop wasting time and money? Here’s a step-by-step guide to implement a strong digital contact center hiring and onboarding program.
Step One: Hire the Right Agents 
 
If you want to offer exceptional customer service, start by transforming your hiring process. Improving the hiring process boosts the overall performance of your operation and customer service, while cutting the cost of providing that service. So now you’re ready to hire stellar agents. Let’s examine the most important qualities to look for in every new hire, as outlined by  Kevin Hegebarth, an expert in customer service and hiring excellent candidates.
•	Technical knowledge: They have a solid understanding for the industry and basic resolution skills.
•	Ability to multitask: They must thrive in a hectic environment and be able to jump from one issue to another quickly.
•	Pleasant phone etiquette: Candidates must have the ability to engage with customers in a pleasant manner and be able to hold a fluid conversation.
•	Ability to stay calm, cool, and collected: They’re able to remain calm and resourceful in any situation, regardless of the circumstances.
•	Ability to focus: They have the ability to stay present and focused on delivering the best possible service to each and every customer.
•	Solution-oriented thinkers: They display a high level of confidence and a propensity to search for a resolution themselves or direct their customers to the appropriate personnel who can provide an answer.
•	Ability to listen and put the customer first: They can use empathy and patience to ensure customers feel catered to and confident that the support representative is hearing their issue and is knowledgeable in the subject matter.
Step Two: Build a Winning Agent Team 
As more people are doing business online, your customer service team is increasingly becoming the center of business growth. Kevin Hegebarth suggests four strategies you can use to build your winning agent workforce.
Four Key Strategies for Hiring Success 

 The Early Bird Gets the Worm
The competition for qualified agent labor is fierce. Make a decision quickly for the best chance to snag the best talent in your market. Applicants are more likely to accept job offers that are made quickly. And that timely hiring decision tends to have a positive effect on the prospective employee’s performance once on the job.
  Let Candidates Know
According to a 2013 national survey by CareerBuilder, over 75% of applicants never hear anything from a hiring company. Zero. Zilch. Nothing. Yet, 82% of them expect some kind of response, even a simple “thanks, but no thanks.” Don’t let your hiring process become a black hole. Responding to each application helps bolster your brand perception on company review sites and leads to more promising candidates.
 Get Everyone Involved
Record applicant interviews and share the most promising candidates with key colleagues to ensure correct hiring decisions are made. It also helps calibrate the recruiting team—in much the same way as your quality assurance teams are calibrated—so that each candidate is evaluated consistently.
 Use Your Crystal Ball (Sort Of)
It takes a lot of time and money hiring each new agent, which is wasted if the new hire doesn’t work out. Big data and predictive analytics can help identify stellar candidates and minimize the risk of a bad hire. Predictive analytics compares the tenure and performance of successful agents with data collected about them during their hiring process. This comparison gives you a data-driven model that can help you evaluate new applicants. If candidates fit the model, they generally perform well against the key metrics of the organization. Move them to the top of your list for hiring consideration.
Step Three: Keep Your Agents Motivated 
 
So you’ve found the right talent, and built your team. Now you’ve arrived at one of the most important steps of all: Invest in your employees. Rewarding agents when they go beyond their job description helps retain top talent.
Remember, happy agents = happy customers. To keep your agents happy, you’ve got to equip them with tools to succeed in their job. Agents who feel supported are more invested in their jobs, and they’re more proactive, productive, and most importantly, more pleasant to customers.
So where to start? According to David Bethers, “fun incentive programs are an easy way to motivate and build team collaboration, while making employees feel rewarded for a job well done. But you also need a plan. These five ways can help agents make a successful career out of customer service.”
1.	New skills: Offer training in digital, social media, and mobile apps and emerging channels.
2.	New motivations: Empower agents to make decisions, highlight agent diversity hiring practices.
3.	New work rules: Give high-performing agents more autonomy that can lead to future positions, offer schedule flexibility, and encourage collaboration within the team.
4.	New metrics: Take another look at agent retention, offer role extensions and paths to promotions.
5.	New career paths: Introduce opportunities for agents to migrate to another department in your organization, such as Marketing, Digital Content, Social Media, or Sales.
Step Four: Deliver Constructive Feedback on Agent Performance 
There are lots of factors that can affect an agent’s performance. As we all know, the contact center can be a stressful place. Agent stress can trigger customer stress, and customer stress can trigger agent stress. If you see an issue escalating on the floor, be sure to talk to your agents to help them recognize and diffuse their stress triggers.
Next, be sure to design the performance conversations in advance and communicate with your agents about how they are assessed. Create an open dialogue established to understand what tools and continued training your agents require to perform at their best.
Finally, deliver constructive and consistent feedback designed to improve agent performance and be clear about how you can support them and their growth aspirations. These steps can go far to ensure that agents earn your respect and trust and that they’re set up for continued success within your organization.

Scoping rules are far more flexible than just wealth management, and can be used as a replacement for Divisions (Classic only) or other scenarios where users may need to focus on a specific brand, department, branch, or other grouping.

Understand Platform Structure and Flow 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe key features of the Flosum platform structure.
•	Identify the typical steps of the development flow within the Flosum platform.
 
This module is sponsored by and produced in collaboration with Flosum, which owns, supports, and maintains the Flosum products, services, and features described here. Use of Flosum products, services, and features is governed by privacy policies and service agreements maintained by Flosum. Learn more about partner content on Trailhead.
Flosum’s Platform Structure 
Salesforce admins and developers know that finding a tool that helps them manage changes across the entire development lifecycle is no easy task. Many DevSecOps (development, security, operations) tools are siloed, which makes visibility and collaboration between teams a real struggle. And still others are not suited for the unique needs of the Salesforce Platform. 
To deliver speedy, secure, and successful Salesforce releases, companies need a solution that streamlines processes, helps them quickly and easily identify and remedy code issues, keeps orgs in sync, and protects and preserves the integrity of customer data. 
Flosum is a complete, end-to-end solution for Salesforce DevSecOps that allows developers and operations teams to orchestrate changes throughout the development lifecycle. Because it’s built on Salesforce and uses the Salesforce interface, Flosum doesn’t need to access or move data elsewhere. 
The Flosum platform offers user-story management, built-in merge tools, version control, continuous deployments, static code analysis, regression-testing solutions, and more. 
Let’s explore Flosum’s structure through the elements of its navigation.  
Navigation Tab	Functionality
Home Tab	Displays the Kanban board and SwimLanes, which let users track all stories, branches, and components; users can define and track promotion paths and manage all their work at the organizational level.
Orgs Tab	Shows users the various orgs that are connected to Flosum, the high-level details of changes that have been made or deployed in each org, code coverage, the audit trail for each org, and more

Flosum also helps teams connect all of their sandboxes, test orgs, and production environments to create a super-smooth development flow. Let’s get into it.
Flosum’s Development Flow 
Ready to go with the flow? Here are the basic steps of development that the developer completes using the Flosum platform:
1.	Creates a branch.
2.	Commits components to the branch.
3.	Ties a user story to the branch.
4.	Makes a request for peer code review.
5.	Merges the various branches into a release branch.
6.	Uses Overwrite Protection to review and resolve any merge conflicts.
7.	Deploys the release branch to testing orgs and then to production.
8.	Commits their changes to the Flosum repository. The Flosum platform automatically deploys those changes to the production org and back-deploys to all sandboxes so that they remain in sync.
 
This flow represents the “best practice” for development; keep in mind that the Flosum platform is flexible, so teams can use it in many ways and adapt it to their needs. 
Now that you’re familiar with the platform’s features and flow, it’s time to break down the first six development steps. Head on over to the next unit to prepare for deployment.

Prepare for Deployment 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe creating a branch.
•	Summarize steps for committing components and tying a user story to a branch.
•	List the benefits of making a request for peer code review.
•	Explain merging branches.
•	Identify how Overwrite Protection helps users detect and resolve code conflicts.
Creating a Branch 
In Flosum, a branch is an independent line of development that allows developers and Salesforce administrators to work in parallel with other team members while keeping their changes separate from the rest of the team’s changes. 
A branch is a separate part of—but connected to—a developer’s repository. A repository can contain multiple branches, and these branches can be merged into the repository when necessary.
Flosum supports many types of branches, including:
•	Feature branches: A feature branch consists of a user story containing each of the features being developed for that user story. (One feature per feature branch is recommended.)
•	Release branches: After the feature branches move through quality assurance (QA), they are merged into a release branch. A release branch will hold the various feature branches until they’re ready to be pushed to production.
Committing Components and Tying a User Story to a Branch 
After a developer has created a branch and tied a user story to the branch, they can modify the components in a development sandbox and add those components to a particular branch. 
Flosum automatically detects the components that have been changed in the development sandbox and shows the details of each component, when it was changed, who changed it, the component type, and the component’s name. 
Users have the option to filter and select components by type and to search components by name. (Flosum supports all component types that Salesforce supports, whether it’s metadata API or tooling API.)
 
At this point in the flow, Flosum will run a code quality scan. Read more about this process here. 
Once a developer is assigned a user story, they can tie it to a branch in Flosum using Jira, ServiceNow, Azure DevOps, or another application lifecycle management (ALM) tool. For example, the user could search for a Jira ticket within the branch and append it to the branch. 
Making a Request for Peer Code Review 
When a developer submits a request, they’re asking that one or more of their team members complete a code review of a branch. 
Developers should ask for a code review before merging into shared branches, deploying to an org, or committing code to a repository. Making requests for peer code review:
•	Increases communication among team members who are working on shared components.
•	Informs team members about changes that have occurred.
•	Results in higher quality deployments.
Merging Branches 
The next step is merging the various user stories or branches that each developer is working on into a release branch. When a user merges branches, Flosum will show the conflicts between both branches or user stories that the user is choosing to merge. The user is then able to resolve the conflicts.  
Using Overwrite Protection 
With the Overwrite Protection feature (formerly known as “Impact Analysis”), users can compare their deployments and their target orgs to detect and resolve code conflicts. The main purpose of this feature is to prevent any changes on the org from being overwritten unintentionally. 
Users can complete these predeployment operations efficiently through Flosum platform’s seamless integration with Salesforce. Now we’re ready to dive into deployment. You’ll learn all about it in the next unit.

Deploy a Release Branch to Production 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe deploying a release branch.
•	Identify how pipelines automate development processes.
•	Summarize how users track and manage the dev process with the Kanban board and SwimLanes.
Deploying a Release Branch 
All deployments are done from the branch records within Flosum. A user can deploy a release branch in one of two ways:
•	Manually: Users execute a standard deployment where they select the org and push the components out to the org.
•	Via Pipelines: Users configure the steps ahead of time and execute them automatically. (We will discuss more about this later.)
When a user attempts to execute a deployment, it shows the deployment history at the top of the Deploy tab. 
 
There, users can see:
•	The deployment name.
•	The changes that have been made.
•	Destructive changes (the removal of components from an org).
Users also can view the metadata logs of deployment, including:
•	How many components were successfully deployed.
•	Which components passed.
•	Which components failed.
Under other tabs within Deploy, users can see the following information and more:
•	Which Jira stories were deployed (Jira)
•	Who approved them (Approval History)
•	Which components were changed (Manifest)
 
After a developer commits their changes to the Flosum repository, the Flosum platform automatically deploys those changes to the production org and back-deploys to all sandboxes so they remain in sync. 
Using Pipelines 
A pipeline allows a user to define and automate the exact series of steps they want executed in the development process. 
Users can automate four different actions:
•	Validations
•	Deployments
•	Rollbacks
•	Webhook calls
Pipelines perform these actions in a series of steps, and include dependent steps based on whether the preceding action has passed or failed. Pipelines also let users select the tests they want to run (for example, specified tests, included tests, or all test options).
Let’s look at an example. Suppose a user has a feature branch that has been approved and is going to use a pipeline to deploy into the integrated development environment (IDE). If the validation is successful, it will deploy to the QA org. If the deployment is successful, it will complete the regression testing on the QA org. If the regression testing is successful, it will take that particular branch and promote it to the production org. If a deployment fails at any point along the way, it does not proceed to the next step. 
Tracking and Managing the Development Process 
The Kanban board on the Flosum Home tab shows where each user story sits in the development process in real time.
 
Users can see how many components are in a branch, how many errors were found, and other details. Users also can select any time frame in the Branches Updated drop-down menu to view changes within that time frame.
The SwimLanes tab lets users configure the order or their operations and processes. 
Flosum helps teams easily manage their DevSecOps lifecycle and Salesforce deployments from beginning to end. The result is high-quality, continuous releases that keep pace with the demands of the market without sacrificing the security of valuable customer data.

Get to Know Enrollments and Deliveries 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Describe how benefit schedule, benefit session, and benefit disbursement records work together to track your work. 
•	Enroll a participant in a program. 
 
Salesforce offers Salesforce for Nonprofits, which includes integrated platform solutions and managed packages. This module provides information about Nonprofit Cloud for Programs, a platform solution. For information about managed package products, see Manage Your Mission with Program Management Module in Trailhead. If you’re not sure which solution your organization uses, check with your Salesforce administrator. 
Before You Start
Before you start this module, consider completing the following recommended content. 
•	Programs and Benefits in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs 
Increase Insights and Impact
When you report on your mission, you likely report high-level totals: the number of people served by a program or the amount of a particular benefit you delivered in a year. 
As you know, those high-level numbers are made up of many small moments. Each class your team leads, every one-on-one counseling session, every meal distributed—it all adds up. 
In this module, you learn about those individual events, which are recorded as benefit disbursement records in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs. 
 
Nonprofit Cloud for Programs is an integrated Salesforce platform solution to give you the insights, collaboration, and efficiency tools to increase your impact. It helps nonprofit organizations like yours define, plan, deliver, and track programs and the benefits they provide—then connect the dots to make real-time decisions about how to improve your work. 
In this unit, we start by discussing some of those dots: The objects and records you use to track your work. 
Understand Schedules and Ad Hoc Benefit Deliveries
The highest-level data in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs are program records, which track the thematic areas of your work. Each program can have many related benefit records, which track what your nonprofit provides to participants and recipients. If you haven’t set up your programs and benefits, start with the Programs and Benefits in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs badge. 
To track a program participant’s eligibility for benefits—like 12 classes or 5 hours of counseling—you use benefit assignment records to account for your benefit disbursements. 
Then, when you provide those benefits, you track that activity with a benefit disbursement record. Benefit disbursements store information about a service, like when it was provided and how much was given. You can measure your benefit disbursements in time, money, goods, or some other criteria. 
You’ll likely create many, many benefit disbursement records. So, Nonprofit Cloud for Programs helps you create and manage benefit disbursements in two ways: by scheduling them in advance and by creating them as needed when they occur. 
You use benefit schedule records to create disbursements for planned sessions. A benefit schedule helps you create one or more benefit sessions, to which you can add participants, track attendance, and efficiently create benefit disbursement records. 
A schedule can be one-time, recurring on a regular schedule, or include many sessions scheduled irregularly. When you create a benefit schedule, a benefit session record is automatically created for every occurrence in the benefit schedule if it’s recurring. 
If you offer a benefit that doesn’t have planned participation—such as a walk-in service or disaster relief—you can create ad-hoc benefit disbursements as needed. You review all of these different scenarios in this module. 
Want to Get Hands-on with Nonprofit Cloud?
In this module, we show you the steps to manage attendance and benefit disbursements in Nonprofit Cloud. We don’t have any hands-on challenges in this module, but if you want to practice and try out the steps, register for a free Nonprofit Cloud trial org with sample data. A regular Trailhead Playground doesn’t have Nonprofit Cloud or our sample data. Here’s how to get the free trial edition now. 
1.	Sign up for a free 30-day Nonprofit Cloud trial org. 
2.	Fill out the form. 
3.	Click Submit. A confirmation message appears. 
4.	When you receive the activation email (this might take a few minutes), open it and click Verify Account. 
5.	Complete your registration by setting your password and challenge question. Tip: Save your username, password, and login URL in a secure place—such as a password manager—for easy access later. 
Your Nonprofit Cloud trial org is ready. 
Enroll a Program Participant
First, you must know how to enroll a participant in a program. You track this relationship with the Program Enrollment object.  
 
If you work with individuals, you might call the people you serve clients, students, guests, or something more specific. You might also serve animals or other organizations. We use the term participant here to refer to anyone—or anything—enrolled in your programs and benefits. We use the term recipient for those people who receive a benefit but aren't enrolled, such as an anonymous recipient. 
Program enrollments can be related to either contact or account records by default. Your person accounts for individuals appear in list views and search as both contacts and accounts, and organizations appear as only accounts. See Stakeholder Management in Nonprofit Cloud in Trailhead for details about person accounts. 
In this badge, you follow along with Hunger No More International (HNMI), a nonprofit working to end hunger and promote healthy food options globally by providing access to nutritious meals, education, and resources. You complete the same steps as Luke Richardson, an HNMI program manager for the organization’s nutrition education work who ensures that program’s effectiveness. 
Luke starts by adding a participant to one of HNMI’s programs by creating a program enrollment record. This example follows the standard process—yours may be different depending on what’s required to enroll a participant in a particular program. Work with your admin to create a custom enrollment process to fit your needs. 
1.	Find and select Program Management from the App Launcher ( ). 
2.	Select the All Programs list view. 
3.	Select the Nutrition Education program from the list view. 
4.	Click Add Participants. 
5.	In the flow, select Contacts to add person accounts to the program. You can also select a list view to further filter the results.
 
6.	Find and select participants from the list. You can add as many as 20 participants to a program at once. Select Alex Brown. 
7.	Save your work. 
 
If your organization wants to track a set of participants as they move through a program together—such as everyone who starts a program in a particular month—group their program enrollments using the Program Cohort object. See Manage Program Cohorts and Cohort Members in Salesforce Help for details. 
Now that you know about the objects you use and have enrolled a program participant, you can dive in to benefit disbursements and benefit schedules in the next unit.

Get Started with Einstein Generative AI 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Describe the core capabilities of generative AI. 
•	Describe how Einstein incorporates the power of generative AI. 
AI in the Spotlight
Over the past decade we've witnessed artificial intelligence (AI) steadily improve at doing things we once thought only humans could do. This has led us to imagine a futuristic world with AI, but one that's still years away. Or so we thought. In early 2023 ChatGPT burst onto the scene, showing the world that the future is already here. Suddenly, AI is responding to complex questions with equally complex answers that sound as if they were written by a human. And because ChatGPT was released for anyone to use, people experienced first-hand how well it could hold a natural-sounding conversation. It has surprised and delighted, and sparked our imaginations yet again. It’s also raised questions about what it means for the future of work. 
In this Quick Look badge, you learn about GPT and how it fits into the larger concept of generative AI. Then, you'll learn how Einstein is the world’s first generative AI for CRM. 
GPT’s Predictive Power
Okay, let's get this out of the way: GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which means a lot to AI researchers but not so much to you and me. Let's just stick with GPT and focus on what it does. 
At a high level, GPT is an AI tool that has been trained to write like we humans do. All it needs is a starting point in the form of a question, request, or even just the beginning of a sentence. And then it continues the thread to create paragraphs of text that are similar to something a real person would write. ChatGPT is a version of GPT that has been fine-tuned to better understand the intention of our instructions, and respond accordingly. You can even tell it to write in a certain style, whether it's poetry, a programming language, or as a pirate. For example, let's see what happens when you ask it to summarize the moon landing in pirate-speak: 
"Ahoy there! Avast ye, matey! 'Tis a tale o' adventure on the high seas o' space! 
Back in the year o' our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, a band o' brave sailors from the land o' America set sail on a quest to reach the moon. They be Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, and they be on a mission from NASA to land on the moon and plant the stars and stripes flag." 
It continues from there, completing the tale in the same silly vernacular. 
So how does it generate such convincing text? OpenAI, the creators of GPT, used a ridiculous amount of computing power to train it. They had it read millions of web pages to learn what words are used near each other, and how they're used together. That made GPT really good at predicting the next word of a sentence by using context. So, imagine you're asked to fill in the blank: "In conversations, my partner and I finish each other's _______." You're likely to choose the word "sentences," and so is GPT. But if you change the context a little: "In restaurants, my partner and I finish each other's _______." There's a better chance you would fill the blank with "sandwiches." Same with GPT. 
GPT writes paragraphs that follow a thread by making an educated guess at each new word in a sentence. It's way better than your phone's predictive text, which if used in the same way only gives you bizarre sentences that make for funny internet memes. 
GPT's ability to write coherent text falls into a broader category of AI known as generative AI. This includes AI tools that can create things like images or audio. As computing power increases, and research continues, generative AI will get better at creating work that’s convincingly human-made. It probably won’t be long before generative AI is part of your everyday life. 
A Future with Generative AI
The arrival of mainstream generative AI has raised a lot of questions about the future of work. People wonder if they'll be replaced with AI. They're concerned about the ethical use of a tool that essentially impersonates humans. They’re skeptical about the quality of what generative AI produces. Obviously, AI must be handled with care. 
Salesforce knows it's critical to establish principles for the ethical use of AI technology. And for the last 6 years, we've had an AI ethics group developing these principles. So when we launch new AI technology, we can help our customers navigate these difficult waters to do the business of business smarter and fairer. Check out the resources section to learn more. 
Our latest AI technology brings the incredible power of generative AI to Einstein and the Salesforce Platform. 
Einstein is built right into Salesforce, so it can use your own data to custom-tailor everything it generates to your unique business. And since Einstein is available across the entire Einstein 1 platform, it's there to improve every customer experience. 
We also recognize that the world of generative AI includes more than just ChatGPT. So we've designed Einstein to allow connections to other language models, such as Anthropic's Claude. This lets you "bring your own model" thanks to APIs and an open ecosystem of generative AI partners. 
Einstein is here to empower your business with amazing generative AI capabilities, using your data and your models for your experiences.

Deliver your Business Objectives 
Learning Objectives  
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Describe what a Salesforce business scenario is.
•	Explain the benefits of using a Salesforce business scenario.
•	Identify what’s included in a Salesforce business scenario.
What Are Business Scenarios? 
We are in the middle of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Companies must adapt to this hyperconnected world and delight customers who are demanding more personalized experiences. But how do you get started? While Salesforce has incredible technology that can power these customer-centric experiences, it’s not always easy to figure out how to tie all of our solutions into your particular business needs.
To help you get started on your digital transformation journey, we have bundled our best content into common use cases. Business scenarios describe tangible, real-world use cases and offer flexible options to help you bridge the gap between your organization’s current business capabilities and the solutions needed to achieve your goals. For each scenario, you discover a variety of Salesforce solutions to help you meet your business objectives, reduce time to value, and even let you plan out longer-term implementation roadmaps. Business scenarios also highlight the platform-agnostic business capabilities that an organization, business, department, or team needs to successfully execute these objectives. Understanding what business capabilities are needed to implement a scenario can help align cross-functional teams around areas for investment, better strategize around technology solutions, and even help expose growth opportunities for team members.
What’s Included in a Business Scenario? 
We’ve created a set of solutions, spanning any number of products, that map to various business scenarios. These are presented at increasing levels of complexity and come from a variety of trusted sources including Trailhead, Help, and Solution Kits. Included are solutions that most closely relate to your organization’s objectives. Each solution considers maturity requirements in terms of people and process, as well as business capability recommendations and best practices
For example, the Data-Driven Advertising Business Scenario outlines a business scenario that exceeds customer expectations by delivering personalized advertising across all of a customer’s devices in a secure, privacy-compliant manner. In order to understand your customer you need to start with data. Delve into your data to develop a deeper understanding of your target shoppers, reach new levels of personalization, and increase audience reach with secure, targeted campaigns.
Each business scenario includes the following.
•	Recommended products: Products that can help you deliver data-driven advertising.
•	Curated solutionsfrom trusted sources, such as Trailhead and Help & Training documents.
o	Beginner solutions are typically out-of-box capabilities that enable quick time to value.
o	Intermediate solutions require integration and custom work.
o	Advanced solutions are typically complex use cases that require a lot of work.
•	Business capabilities: Best practices to grow your maturity and develop considerations for the solution implementation.
•	Resources: Additional resources or business scenarios that support implementing the solution.
How to Use a Business Scenario  
The business scenario answers the “what” and helps an architect or line of business manager understand which business capabilities are recommended, which products they need to consider as part of the solutions, and a curated set of solutions designed to meet these needs.
These business scenarios provide you with the best practices and guidance on selecting the right solutions and products for your organization. Follow these steps to get started using business scenarios.
1.	Review business capabilities required to achieve the business scenario.
2.	Assess the maturity levels of your organization’s business capabilities.
3.	Review the best practices with minimum maturity level to understand how your business can improve in each area of capability.
4.	Review products and solutions to achieve faster time to value and build a roadmap as you increase your maturity.

Get to Know Cybersecurity Risk Management 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Describe the goals of a cybersecurity risk management program. 
•	Explain the importance of managing cybersecurity risks. 
What Is Cybersecurity Risk Management?
Your company just closed a deal to use a new cloud computing service. Whoopee! This new technology makes it easier to automate application development and bring new opportunities. But let’s pause for a moment. Have you considered the potential impact if the data processed by this new technology is compromised by an attacker? Have you thought about the risks? 
This is where cybersecurity risk management comes into play. Cybersecurity risk management is the process of managing risks associated with digital business assets. It involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s assets. As a cybersecurity risk manager you strive to improve visibility into risks at the enterprise, business unit, and system-level, in order to strengthen an organization’s cyber resilience. Cyber resilience refers to an organization’s ability to prevent, detect, respond, and recover from cyber threats. In a world of constant change, new cyber risks and threats arise daily. You enable their organization to respond to events in a timely way, in order to minimize business disruption and financial losses. Suffice to say, it’s a pretty important role! 
So, going back to our example at the beginning, how do you, as a cyber risk manager, identify the risks of using the new cloud computing service? To begin with, you need to consider the likelihood that known threats exploit vulnerabilities. For example, is there sensitive customer data stored in the cloud that an attacker would be interested in stealing? Are there known vulnerabilities in the applications running in the cloud that would allow an attacker to access the information? What is the potential financial, operational, and reputational impact on your company if such a breach occurs? How likely is it that this scenario actually happens? These are the types of questions a risk manager thinks about every day. 
 
A vulnerability is defined as the state of being exposed to the possibility of attack. In cybersecurity this can be a flaw in an application’s code that lets an attacker change the behavior of the application and steal sensitive information. 
Once the risk of a certain program, system, or technology is identified, the organization takes actions to protect itself from the risk. Imagine you are buying health insurance. When you have health insurance, you do not have to worry as much about the cost of your healthcare bills. If you have an accident, you know you can get good quality care and recover quickly. When you choose your insurance plan, you carefully consider the benefits and costs of each plan in order to decide on the one that best suits your healthcare needs. In the same way, as a cybersecurity risk manager, you compare the costs and benefits of mitigating cyber risk by implementing protections, and advising the organization to implement the best action plan. 
 
Just like purchasing insurance reduces the risk associated with accidents, managing cyber risk “buys down” the potential impact if data is compromised by an attacker. Although it’s impossible to fully eliminate all risk, managing cyber risk minimizes the likelihood that an attacker can exploit a vulnerability. If an attacker is successful in breaching a system, risk management can still minimize business disruption and financial losses, so the organization can get back to business faster.  
The Importance of Managing Cyber Risks
As your organization acquires new technology assets and becomes ever more connected, the threats to your customer’s and your business’ data expand as well. It’s time to put a plan in place to deliver the right amount of cyber protections, so your customers know that they can trust your organization to secure their information. Managing cyber risks means making conscious decisions about securing sensitive information. 
As a cyber risk manager, you work to make risk identification and evaluation easier, so everyone, from your boss to your customers, understands the organization’s tolerance for risk, and the actions and associated costs necessary to manage it. Although managing cybersecurity risk can’t ensure that you always make the correct decisions, it does ensure that everyone understands who is responsible for managing a given risk to acceptable levels. 
Every organization is unique when it comes to risk and how much it’s willing to take on. But managing cyber risks is an activity that is important for small and large organizations, around the world in every industry, from finance to healthcare to government to energy. Smaller companies may outsource risk management functions to a third party. You may be in charge of working with one of these vendors. Or you may even work for a company that sells cybersecurity risk management services. As a member of the cyber risk management team in a larger organization, you may need to work with many teams across the enterprise to holistically understand risk, including integrating with the Enterprise Risk Management Team. This team manages the organization’s financial, operational, legal, and other risks, in addition to cybersecurity risks at a strategic, enterprise level.

Cybersecurity Risk Manager Responsibilities
Are you a great analyzer, influencer, and problem solver? Do you enjoy understanding threats and analyzing data to better understand risk? Do you like to come up with action-oriented improvement plans? If so, managing cybersecurity risks can be the perfect job for you! 
Let’s meet David. He is a cybersecurity risk manager at a cybersecurity services company. David identifies and analyzes risks facing the organization and its systems, and then he prioritizes the most likely and impactful cybersecurity risks. He understands threats and challenges facing the organization, and gathers and uses data to assess risks to the business. His goal is to enable business system owners, executives, and other stakeholders to make risk-informed decisions to manage risks at an acceptable level. 
David has a challenging but pivotal role. It’s his job to try to mitigate risks by working with key stakeholders and leadership to lessen the likelihood and impact of a given risk.  
In doing so, David has to balance risks and rewards, much like someone carefully balances while walking across a tightrope. His company faces many threats to its valuable systems and data, such as denial of service attacks from malicious actors who want to overwhelm his servers so that his customers cannot access them. He also has a limited amount of financial, staff, and technological resources to address the risks posed by these threats. Once he has worked with partners to identify the most likely and highly impactful risks, it’s his job to help the organization prioritize risks in a logical way.  
 
David likes understanding how all the pieces of the risk puzzle in his organization fit together. He researches frameworks applicable to his given industry and uses them to assess the current protections and provide opportunities for improvements, in order to manage risks to an acceptable level. He also works with teams across the business to help them improve their risk posture. He makes sure each part of the organization understands its role in managing risk. Once he and his partners have assessed their risk and current protections, he advises system owners on the implementation of technical controls to help mitigate risk, and documents risk decisions for the organization.  
 
As a risk manager you are not responsible for implementing technical controls yourself, or for eliminating all risks facing the enterprise. Rather you work with system owners to prioritize high impact, likely risks for remediation and advise on mitigation strategies.  
David is like a detective who constantly searches for clues about the current risk posture of his company. Once mitigations have been put in place, he gathers data to help monitor the organization’s risk posture, and forms close relationships across the business to validate and assess the risk posture accurately. He has his finger on the pulse of the organization's risk posture at any given moment, and recognizes problems early. His work is never done, and he evolves his strategy for managing risk as the threat and technology landscapes evolve.  
Cybersecurity Risk Manager Skills
So, like David, you’re ready to understand the threats against organizations and figure out how to thwart them in order to buy-down risk. What skills do you need to land your dream job?  
First, it helps to have a bachelor’s degree. Your degree doesn’t have to be in a specific area, but risk managers often have an educational background in computers, information science, engineering, systems analysis, information technology, cybersecurity, or even accounting. There are also certifications you can pursue to bolster your security skills, including the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Information Security Manager (CISM), or Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) certifications, to name a few.  
In terms of technical skills, as a cybersecurity risk manager you are a great analyzer, who understands cybersecurity and technology, systems management, and project management. You have skills in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, threat modeling, and scenario analysis. Risk modeling is another great skill to have, even if you’ve practiced it in another industry, such as finance. 
Technical skills help you as a risk manager understand and solve security problems, but you must also have business know-how. You use your influence and persuasion skills to advise on decisions with significant organizational impact. You are a great communicator who enjoys collaborating to get things done and advocate for security best practices. You like building trust and consensus across organizational teams, and you are both detail-oriented and think strategically to solve problems.  
Finally, as a cybersecurity risk manager, you have a passion for researching, analyzing, and applying different regulatory and policy frameworks to help your organization meet industry standards in an efficient manner. Some of the most common frameworks you should be familiar with are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, and ISO/IEC 27001/2 Information Technology standards, although there are many more to learn about!

Before You Start 
If you completed Get Started with Application Security, then you already know how to protect networks and prevent network attacks. Now let’s talk about how to use a web application firewall (WAF) to defend your application perimeter from malicious traffic. 
What Is WAF Security? 
According to Cloudflare, a WAF creates a shield between a web application and the internet; this shield can help mitigate many common attacks. It helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic between a web application and the internet.
Just as a tollbooth allows paying customers to drive across a toll road, and prevents nonpaying customers from accessing the roadway, network traffic must pass through a firewall, before it’s allowed to reach a server. WAFs use adaptable policies to defend against vulnerabilities in a web application, allowing for easy policy modification, and faster response to new attack vectors. 
 
A WAF defends applications from malicious traffic. While other security solutions, such as traditional firewalls, mostly work based on ports and protocols, a WAF has to understand and examine the application layer traffic. A WAF typically protects web applications from attacks such as:
•	Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Also known as Sea Surf or Session Riding, this is an attack vector that tricks a web browser into executing unwanted actions in applications logged into by the user. This attack can result in unauthorized fund transfers, changed passwords, and data theft.
•	Cross-site scripting (XSS): An attack that tricks a web browser into running malicious code. That malicious code can be inserted in several ways. Often, it is either added to the end of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or posted directly onto a page that displays user-generated content.
•	File inclusion: An attack technique in which hackers trick a web application into running or exposing files on a server. If this occurs, sensitive information could be exposed and in some cases lead to XSS and other damaging attacks.
•	Structured Query Language (SQL) injection: An attack that surfaces as a result of malicious code being plugged into an unsuspecting database. With this technique attackers can access information that was not intended to be seen by the public, such as private customer details or company data, which is highly detrimental toward a business’s interests.
•	Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): An attack that disrupts normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. It uses multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
A WAF operates through a set of rules often called policies. These policies aim to protect against vulnerabilities in the application by filtering out malicious traffic. The value of a WAF comes in part from the speed and ease with which application security engineers can implement policy modification, allowing for faster response to the above attack types.
In other words, a WAF is one of the tools responsible for securing business-critical web apps from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10, zero-day threats, known or unknown application vulnerabilities, and an array of other web application layer attacks that can impact your organization.
As organizations undergo new digital initiatives, their attack surface may expand as they enable new business. As a result, they often find that new web applications and application programming interfaces (APIs) become exposed to dangerous traffic due to web server vulnerabilities, a server plugin, or other issues exploited by threats that aim to disrupt organizations. WAFs help to keep these applications and the content they access secure.
Why WAFs Are Critical for Organizations 
Organizations increasingly use web application technologies as part of digital innovation (DI) efforts. As a result, organizations require a fundamental change in the way they conduct business using digital technology. DI means that you have more web applications touching more critical and sensitive data. Organizations that can protect their web applications can move faster, and can put new capabilities into the hands of their users more quickly, and more securely.
For organizations to successfully implement DI efforts, they need to do more than simply deploy technologies. They also need to focus on the needs of customers, and be willing to embrace rapid change, including rapid adoption and technology deployment options to meet the needs of customers.
Organizations can use public cloud and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions to accelerate their businesses, but they must protect them with strict security rules. As organizations rapidly adopt these technologies, the speed of business operations also increases, and web application security flaws arise, leaving web applications at risk from threats hiding in internet traffic.
As customers increasingly access business applications using unknown bring your own devices (BYOD) on networks that are not controlled with virtual private network (VPN) access, organizations should recognize the risks. Even network firewalls can be vulnerable. Traditional perimeter application security tools are not adequate for protecting internet-facing applications from OWASP Top 10 dangers and other application vulnerabilities found in network traffic.
Organizations need a new set of rules and tools to defend business-critical applications– WAF is a solution that protects these applications and data.
What Types of Threats Do WAFs Prevent? 
Modern web applications require a comprehensive WAF to protect important applications against multiple types of web attacks and other threats lurking in network traffic. 
The OWASP Top 10 “represents a broad consensus about the most critical application security threats to web applications.” Attackers often leverage these threats to target critical network appliances. The OWASP Top 10 includes:
Top 10 Web Application Security Risks	Description
1. Broken access control	When user access and restrictions are not enforced, unauthorized users can potentially access confidential files.
2. Cryptographic failures	Since many web applications and APIs lack data security, attackers can exploit sensitive financial, healthcare, and personal information.
3. Injection	When untrusted data is sent to an interpreter, an attacker can inject malicious code. What’s more, when an application includes untrusted data without validation, cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws occur that can be used to perform attacks.
4. Insecure Design	Risks exist related to design flaws. These can be mitigated using threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures.
5. Security misconfiguration	Many legacy Extensible Markup Language (XML) processors evaluate extremal entities, which can be leveraged to disclose internal files. What’s more, default or ad-hoc configurations can lead to security misconfigurations that lead to vulnerabilities.
6. Vulnerable and outdated components	Components often run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerability occurs, all components and applications can be compromised.
7. Identification and authentication failures	If authentication mechanisms are not implemented properly, attackers can expose these vulnerabilities
8. Software and data integrity failures	These failures can lead to remote code execution which can be used to perform attacks.
9. Security logging and monitoring failures	Logging and monitoring that does not integrate with an incident response technology creates insufficient protection processes.
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)	Allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location. This can result in unauthorized actions or access to data within an organization, either in the vulnerable application itself or on other back-end systems that the application can communicate with.
However, taking the OWASP Top 10 into consideration is just the beginning. OWASP describes the Top 10 as a list of the most pervasive risks that organizations should consider. Modern WAF security must go further to address risks outside the scope of the OWASP Top 10, including the following.
Risk	Description
Bots	Bots are programs that interact with your applications and often mimic human interaction. Good bots may be allowed to interact with an application, and include: search engines, virtual assistants, and content aggregators (for example., price comparison sites). Bad bot activity can include: web scraping, competitive data mining, personal and financial data harvesting, account takeover and transaction fraud.
Malicious uploads	Many web applications allow users to upload their own content, which can include a variety of malicious code payloads.
Unknown vulnerabilities	Signature-based solutions cannot protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities. A robust WAF solution must be able to defend against threats for which no signatures exist.
Zero-day attacks	Zero-day attacks target previously unknown flaws in an application. When a threat actor discovers a zero-day vulnerability, they can use it to exploit systems that do not have additional defensive measures in place, such as a WAF.
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)	In a DDoS attack, attackers use a large number of systems, often a botnet of compromised computers, to overwhelm an application so that it cannot respond to legitimate user requests. Using DDoS attacks, attackers can attempt to simply overwhelm the system with traffic or may attempt to exploit a flaw in the application logic to achieve the same result.
Sum It Up

Learn How Web Application Firewalls Protect APIs 
Learning Objectives 
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
•	Identify how web application firewalls (WAFs) deliver application programming interface (API) protection.
•	List how WAFs help organizations meet compliance rules.
•	Define how advanced WAF capabilities can help your organization protect data from modern threats.
•	Describe how to choose a WAF product.
How WAFs Deliver API Protection 
The days of basic websites serving up simple Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages have passed. Traffic has become more sophisticated. Web applications today deliver mission-critical services using APIs that provide richer, more responsive experiences by letting the client process raw data instead of just rendering simple HTML.
These API tools also support the mobile applications that users in the community need to access. When the client has access to a large amount of application data, the impact of an attacker exploiting the API's rules when a WAF isn't in place can be significant. These tools require a WAF to ensure they are protected from OWASP Top 10 threats. WAFs can protect against file inclusion vulnerabilities and others seeking to take advantage of internet traffic, a server plugin, or other vulnerabilities.
 
Not all WAFs have API security capabilities. The addition of API capabilities is how WAFs evolve to web application and API protection (WAAP).
 
WAFs for Compliance 
Making the data that web applications rely on available to the application often comes with compliance obligations. WAFs help organizations meet compliance rules as well. Regardless of your service provider, compliance needs to be your primary priority.
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), for example, defines a set of application security standards that organizations handling credit cards must comply with. PCI 6.6 specifically will often come up when discussing web application firewall technologies designed to keep traffic and assets secure. The standard requires inspection of traffic to web applications that interact with card data. To comply with the standard, organizations have two options.
1.	Web application code reviews (which can slow down deployments)
2.	Deploying WAFs between the client and the web application.
In a world where organizations are expected to frequently and rapidly deploy code changes as they adopt software development and IT operations (DevOps) methodologies, a robust WAF will often be a better solution for meeting these types of compliance rules while protecting the organization from OWASP Top 10 threats.
Advanced Capabilities of Web Application Firewalls 
Let’s take a look at some advanced WAF capabilities, such as machine learning, for delivering both accurate detection and reduced management overhead.
Machine Learning
Traditional web application learning techniques require manual tuning and are prone to false positives. Tuning applications every time there is a change and remediating false positives drives up administrative overhead for teams and others in the organization's community that may already be overburdened.
WAFs can use machine learning to update their protection model automatically as the web application evolves. This means application security teams and others in the IT department spend less time manually tuning the web application firewalls according to traffic and creating exceptions based on false positives.
Advanced Reporting
WAFs can provide organizations full visibility into event details. They can generate attack logs that include the critical information that security operations center (SOC) analysts need, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) body information, and clear indications on why security rules require an application request to be blocked.
Choosing a WAF Product 
In choosing a WAF product, organizations should look for one that includes the following capabilities. 
•	Backed by threat intelligence
•	OWASP Top 10 protection
•	API WAF management
•	Bot mitigation
•	DDoS protection
•	File protection
•	Information leak prevention
•	Cross site request forgery (CSRF) protection
•	Web socket security
•	API security
You should also consider the infrastructure used to deliver the WAF, whether it can be easily integrated with your sandbox and other security solutions, whether it includes a content delivery network (CDN), and whether its attack logs can be easily exported to your external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.

Get to Know Cybersecurity Compliance Analysis 
Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Describe the goals of cybersecurity compliance analysis. 
•	Explain the importance of cybersecurity compliance analysis. 
What Is Cybersecurity Compliance?
Cybersecurity trailblazers make security intrinsic to their business. There’s a rising and enormous cost associated with data breaches, a trend that’s driving the need for more robust cybersecurity strategies. According to a report by Accenture, in their annual survey among 4,744 global respondents around the current state of cybersecurity resilience, about one-third of all respondents say poor governance and compliance is a problem. 
To help protect businesses and consumers from these breaches, governments, regulators, and organizations put in place laws, regulations, standards, and policies that address issues of cybersecurity and data protection. If your business collects, stores, or uses sensitive information, then failure to comply with these mandates can have a profound impact on your business processes. A data breach can lead to a significant financial loss, market share value loss, as well as costs spent on compensating affected customers.  
In general, compliance is defined as following rules and meeting requirements. In cybersecurity, compliance means creating and maintaining a program that establishes risk-based controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information stored, processed, or transferred. These controls are used to demonstrate adherence to the applicable compliance requirements in order to establish the necessary level of security. 
Cybersecurity compliance analysis is the process of assessing whether the behavior of an information technology (IT) system or application conforms to the cybersecurity rules and regulations in force. Effective cybersecurity compliance analysis helps you prioritize compliance risks, maps compliance risks to the applicable parts of the organization that must help address them, and effectively allocates resources to mitigate compliance risks. This analysis can be performed either by an internal team or a third party. While a business may have compliance analysts focused on other types of rules and regulations—such as standard accounting principles, medical treatment protocols, or laws against criminal activity—cybersecurity compliance involves rules and regulations specifically pertaining to protecting sensitive data by securing IT systems. 
As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, your work helps to protect sensitive information, including: 
•	Personally identifiable information (PII), such as first and last name, date of birth, and government-issued personal identification number (PIN). 
•	Protected health information (PHI), such as medical history, records of admissions, and prescription records. 
•	Financial data, such as credit card numbers, bank account numbers, and debit card PINs. 
•	Authenticators, including biometrics such as fingerprints, voice prints, and facial recognition data. 
•	Other sensitive data, such as IP addresses, email addresses, usernames, and passwords. 
Failing to adequately screen your and your suppliers’ security for protections of this data can increase the likelihood of data breaches, which can shut down operations, damage customer trust, and incur hefty regulatory penalties. For these reasons, your analysis of the security compliance of your organization's internal and external systems must be comprehensive, efficient, and scalable. 
 
The Importance of Cybersecurity Compliance
Now that we know what cybersecurity compliance is, let’s talk about why it’s important. Cybersecurity compliance helps companies, governments, and other entities process sensitive data securely. It makes sense of existing and new laws, regulations, standards, and policies to help organizations ensure they follow cybersecurity rules or guidelines.  
Cyberattacks happen all the time, and the number and variety of attacks continues to grow, making efficient cybersecurity difficult for most organizations. With a drastic shortage in trained cybersecurity professionals, today’s environment has become increasingly challenging. As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, you play a crucial role in protecting your organization from the next attack. 
Cybersecurity Risk Management vs Compliance
It’s important to note that, while similar, cybersecurity risk management and cybersecurity compliance are not necessarily the same thing. Compliance requirements often lag behind cybersecurity risk. Simply put, it’s not enough to just be compliant with the bare minimum regulatory requirements. Your organization should also understand its cybersecurity risk posture as a whole, and put in place policies and controls to respond to these risks. In doing so, you have a crucial role to play. You must work with the cybersecurity risk managers in your organization to ensure not only compliance with applicable regulations, policies, and frameworks but also that the organization is doing its best to create a security culture that extends beyond compliance. 
A key part of this is streamlining cybersecurity efforts to be both compliant and secure, without imposing multiple, competing requirements on the business. You do so by cutting across organizational silos, aggregating information, and working with cybersecurity risk managers to provide a 360-degree view of IT risk, compliance, policy management, and vendor security practices. This enables your organization to execute and manage an effective cyber resilience strategy that both addresses compliance concerns and ensures the organization is managing cyber risk holistically without increasing the reporting burden on your teams. 
Cybersecurity compliance touches every business that needs to collect, maintain, analyze, and protect some type of sensitive data. This makes cybersecurity compliance important, no matter what industry you work in. What’s more, organizations that perform internal audits and undergo third-party audits and assessments know it plays a critical role in helping their ongoing battle of managing cyber threats. These audits and assessments provide an independent review of existing and needed controls, and help the organization understand and address the diverse risks of the digital landscape. 
Meeting or exceeding regulatory compliance standards and requirements has benefits for organizations beyond protecting sensitive data as required by law. Implementing the appropriate safeguards and security measures to protect sensitive customer and employee information bolsters your company’s security posture. This, in turn, helps to protect intellectual property such as trade secrets, software code, product specifications, and other information that gives your company a competitive advantage.

Are you driven to make businesses more secure? Are you passionate about process improvement? Do you thrive on developing innovative insights to solve complex challenges? If you answered yes to these questions, then cybersecurity compliance analysis may be a great fit for you. 
What do you like to do? 
The work of a compliance analyst involves conducting audits and assessments, and assisting with risk management reviews and third-party assessments. In this role, your goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of an organization’s data and systems. You also work with teams across the organization to identify and mitigate cybersecurity compliance risks, and manage reporting on cybersecurity compliance to both internal and external stakeholders. You document the organization's cybersecurity compliance posture in written reports, manage compliance efforts to meet both internal and external deadlines, and help prioritize the most critical compliance gaps to be addressed first. 
What type of organization do you want to work for?  
You might work for an advisory service firm, helping companies develop reports to demonstrate compliance with various laws, regulations, and standards. You may work in the healthcare industry, helping your organization protect patients’ protected health information (PHI) by assisting with compliance and documentation tasks. Or, you may work for the government, participating in the steps of the authorization process to ensure government systems are secure, and documenting security controls in approved templates and forms. Almost every industry that conducts digital business needs cybersecurity compliance analysts. 
When are you involved in an organization’s work?  
When in the audit and compliance lifecycle do you get involved? You have a role to play every step of the way—from helping put in place organizational policies that ensure your systems are compliant with applicable laws and regulations, to supporting internal and third-party audits, or inspections, of systems in production to ensure that cybersecurity standards are upheld. You also contribute to security designs during system development and help to maintain a compliant system once it’s been deployed.  
Being involved throughout the entire lifecycle of a system is key. For example, if you work at a merchant that accepts cardholder data, you may have verified during system development that your payment system satisfies the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) requirements. But if the system is then improperly deployed, or deployed in a hosting environment with other violations, you have not achieved compliance. Maintaining system controls and preventing configuration creep entails putting in place processes and measures that can be tracked and checked in real time to keep from falling out of compliance. 
How are you successful in the role?  
How do you accomplish all of this? To give you a closer look, let’s meet Earl, a cybersecurity compliance analyst. He works at a government organization that specializes in protecting consumer financial interests by creating and enforcing consumer financial protection laws, including laws about how companies must implement cybersecurity protections to protect customer financial data. As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, Earl: 
•	Provides guidance to help financial companies understand and comply with cybersecurity rules and statutes related to customer financial data. Some of these resources include regulatory guidance, a map of money transmission laws, and guides for financial sector executives, for example. 
•	Conducts examinations of how companies comply with laws related to securing customer financial data. For example, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s Safeguards Rule, financial institutions must have measures in place to keep customer information such as names, phone numbers, and credit card account numbers secure. Earl may conduct examinations of these financial institutions to verify they have a written cybersecurity plan that describes their program to protect customer information. 
•	Leads deep dives into systems that accept, store, process and transmit cardholder data at merchants, banks, and credit card processors to evaluate their compliance with regulations to investigate security gaps. 
•	Evaluates how companies’ policies stack up to regulations by analyzing documentation, roles and responsibilities, and processes to ensure systems meet security requirements. 
•	Assesses management and technical controls to ensure specific security compliance requirements are met. Some of these requirements include building and maintaining a secure network and systems, protecting cardholder data, and maintaining a vulnerability management program, to name a few. 
•	Validates the maintenance of secure configurations for systems, such as those that accept, store, process, and transmit cardholder data. 
•	Shares key examination findings to help organizations limit security risks and comply with laws relating to securing customer financial data. 
•	Works in a consultative role to help organizations securely navigate an evolving information technology (IT) environment and stay compliant with applicable laws and regulations. 
Why should you consider this role? 
Why should you consider a cybersecurity compliance analyst career like Earl's? This is a fast-growing field in a crucial industry. As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, you work across the business, getting exposure to implementing and managing the various aspects of a security program—including perimeter defense, access control, encryption, and more. You also make a real impact in raising awareness of the potential for a data incident, and contributing to the organization’s compliance reporting. This role also has lots of room to learn and grow. Last but not least, you can earn competitive compensation. Sounds pretty great, right? 
Cybersecurity Compliance Analyst Skills
Like Earl, you’re excited about helping organizations understand, implement, and comply with cybersecurity laws, regulations, standards, and policies. So, what education and skills do you need to pursue this career? 
Education 
It’s possible to find certain entry-level cybersecurity positions that require applicants to have a course of post-secondary study lasting 2 or 3 years. However, most jobs require a 4-year bachelor's degree in cybersecurity or a related field, such as IT or computer science, a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discipline, or business administration.  
 
Experience 
Typically, employers look for candidates with anywhere from 2 to 8 years of experience analyzing the development of cybersecurity policies and strategies. Experience with risk analysis is also valuable. Cybersecurity compliance analysts also need experience briefing clients and team members on technical, policy, and functional issues.  
Certifications 
To help you skill up and get your foot in the door, pursuing a certification is a great idea. Here are some common certifications for cybersecurity compliance analysts (note that some certifications require a certain number of years of experience before they can be obtained). 
•	The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) A+ (Plus) Certification 
•	The International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC)² Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP). Note that this certificate requires 5 years of experience to complete. If you do not have the requisite experience, you can become an Associate of (ISC)² in the meantime while you gain the required work experience. 
•	The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA). Note that this certificate requires 5 years of experience, but there are some ways to bring that down based on other related work experience and education. 
•	The Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Security Essentials (GSEC) Certification 
•	ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Certification 
Knowledge 
As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, having a solid understanding of the basics—such as security frameworks, regulations, and standards—is key. You should have strong familiarity with security governance, compliance, and risk management frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) Cybersecurity Framework, ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information Related Technology (COBIT) framework, and PCI DSS, to name a few. It’s also helpful to have knowledge of control assessment techniques, which include questionnaires, on-site visits, and penetration tests. Additional areas of expertise that are helpful, but not required, include data protection, access control, network and endpoint security, incident response and handling, vulnerability management, and firewalls.  
Business Skills 
In addition to these technical skills, it’s also critical to hone your business skills. A huge part of being successful as a cybersecurity compliance analyst is effectively communicating and documenting requirements and findings, analyzing security gaps, and thinking strategically. You should know how to consult with various stakeholders in an organization, as well as demonstrate exemplary leadership and organizational skills. You should enjoy working as part of a team, researching answers to questions and problems, and paying close attention to detail.  
Skills-first 
While traditional qualifications like education and certifications are important, cybersecurity is increasingly shifting toward a skills-first approach. This means employers are prioritizing demonstrated evidence of skills and abilities over formal credentials alone. To prepare for this changing landscape engage in team and independent projects that build proficiency in key skills. Document these projects in a portfolio of work (e.g., github, personal website) as tangible proof of your proficiency to send along with a resume and to showcase during interviews. Finally, during interviews, be prepared to demonstrate to employers that you possess the required skills they seek.

Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 
•	Explain the key features and tools in Grantmaking. 
•	Define some objects used to track information with Grantmaking. 
•	Describe examples of how to use Grantmaking at public sector and nonprofit organizations. 
 
Salesforce offers both integrated platform solutions and managed packages. This module covers Grantmaking, an integrated solution in Salesforce. 
For more information about Grants Management, a managed package product that’s different from Grantmaking, complete the Grants Management Basics module. 
If you’re unsure which solution your organization uses, check with your Salesforce administrator. 
Goal: Grantmaking Greatness
If you work for a grantmaking organization, or a nonprofit that delivers funding, you’re in the business of progress. Sure, the way you achieve those outcomes is by processing applications and granting money to people and organizations working toward your shared goals—but you’re looking for results. 
You need a solution that delivers, manages, and tracks funding programs to create stronger outcomes. A system that minimizes your time spent on process and compliance is key to success. 
Meet Grantmaking, a Salesforce solution for foundations, nonprofits, government agencies, and other public sector organizations that provide funding for a specific purpose. It’s an end-to-end grantmaking solution that drives efficiency, creates positive experiences for grantees, and invests in better outcomes. 
Grantmaking helps you manage the entire grantmaking process. It extends your Salesforce instance to give you a unified view of your funding programs throughout the planning, delivery, and evaluation stages.  
Plus, a site template for Experience Cloud helps you create an online portal to communicate and collaborate with your grantees. Here’s an example home page based on the site template. 
 
The home page presents the imaginary foundation's mission statement with options to access funding opportunities, the application process, awards, and more. 
In this Quick Look module, you gain an overview of Grantmaking and its features. 
The Salesforce Framework for Managing Grants
Grantmaking adds to Salesforce’s relationship management tools with features designed to manage funding opportunities, set grant budgets, review grant applications, award grants, and manage disbursements on an ongoing basis. 
Let’s explore some objects that help you do that. 
Start by creating your funding programs in Salesforce using the Program object. 
Use the Budget object to define program spending. Budgets enable you to set and track grantmaking budgets for each of your programs, projects, or departments. For example, create budgets for the amount of money available to a program each year. Applicants can also submit project budgets when they apply, based on templates you configure. 
You manage available grant opportunities using the Funding Opportunity object. Funding opportunities can include descriptions of available grants, application instructions, and application start and end dates. You can display these opportunities through your Experience Cloud site, too. 
Funding opportunities can be related to application forms you create using the Action Plan Template, Individual Application Task, and Application Stage Definition objects, along with Omniscript, Flexcard, and Flow Builder. 
After an application is entered, you track it from start to finish with the Individual Application object. 
After an application is in the system, capture feedback from your team using the Application Review object. Standardize how your team works using built-in Salesforce automation tools and other features like action plans, document checklists, and approval processes. 
Then, manage your decisions using the Application Decision and Funding Award objects. Plus, track money sent to grantees using the Funding Disbursement object. Manage additional steps a grantee must take—like interim or annual reports—using the Funding Award Requirement object. 
Then track spending against the budget to neatly close the cycle. 
Grantmaking in Action
By now you can imagine how Grantmaking fits into your organization’s grantmaking lifecycle. It helps to explore some examples, though. 
Let’s start by visiting the city of Cosville. Its small business administration focuses on boosting the municipality’s economy. However, it spends too much time on cumbersome administrative processes like collecting feedback and entering budget data.  
With Grantmaking and an Experience Cloud site, Cosville can track reviews in one place to speed up decision making and automate manual tasks. Then it can work with grantees to file their budget numbers directly into Salesforce through an Experience Cloud portal. The result: More time spent on outcomes, less on data entry and chasing down reviewers. 
Now imagine the Mountain Rise Foundation (MRF), a private foundation. It has a small-but-mighty team that wants to build better relationships with grantees. By using Grantmaking and an Experience Cloud site, the foundation streamlines communications with applicants and grantees at every step of the grantmaking lifecycle. Grantmaking has transformed the grantee experience and optimized program outcomes. 
Can you think of how Grantmaking could fit into your organization?
